## How to find the number of possible combinations of a given set of numbers?

I have a set of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

I want to find the number of possible combinations of these numbers.

For example, if I have 3 numbers, the possible combinations are:

123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 156, 157, 158, 159, 167, 168, 169, 176, 177, 178, 179, 186, 187, 188, 189, 196, 197, 198, 199.

I want to find the number of possible combinations of 3 numbers from the given set.


## Output

 To find the number of possible combinations of a given set of numbers, we can use the concept of permutations. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by the formula:

\[ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \]

where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>

A rustic 18th-century timber-framed granary stands on staddle stones at the Bursledon Windmill site in Hampshire, England, surrounded by lush greenery.

**Description:**  
The image depicts a historical scene at the Bursledon Windmill site in Hampshire, England. A weathered wooden granary, raised on traditional mushroom-shaped staddle stones, is the focal point. The granary, likely from the 18th century, features a slanted roof and a wooden door. In the foreground, a large, weathered timber lies on the grass, possibly a remnant of the windmill's machinery. The background is filled with dense, green foliage, indicating a warm summer day. A brick structure with rounded stones is visible to the left, adding to the historical ambiance.

In the foreground, there is a large, weathered timber, which appears to be part of the old windmill's machinery. The timber is positioned on the grass, adding a rustic touch to the scene.

The background of the image is dominated by a lush green landscape, with dense trees and shrubs. The trees are tall and leafy, providing a natural canopy over the area. The sunlight casts shadows on the ground, indicating a sunny day.

The image captures a moment of tranquility and historical preservation, highlighting the enduring legacy of rural English heritage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>

Historic Bursledon Windmill Site: Hiltinbury Granary and Remnants of Agricultural Heritage

### Description
The image captures the serene and historic Bursledon Windmill site in Hampshire, England, on a warm August afternoon. The focal point is the Hiltinbury Granary, an 18th-century timber-framed building raised on staddle stones, traditional mushroom-shaped stone pillars used to protect stored grain from rodents and dampness. In the foreground, a large, weathered timber, likely part of the old windmill's machinery, rests on the grass. The scene is framed by lush summer foliage, highlighting the rustic beauty and functional design of rural English heritage.
