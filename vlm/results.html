# User

Create a Python script that reads a CSV file containing two columns: &#x27;Name&#x27; and &#x27;Age&#x27;. The script should calculate the average age of the individuals listed and print the result.


# Pandas library is required for this task.


# AI

```python

import pandas as pd


# Read the CSV file

df = pd.read_csv(&#x27;people.csv&#x27;)


# Calculate the average age

average_age = df[&#x27;Age&#x27;].mean()


# Print the result

print(f&quot;The average age of the individuals is: {average_age}&quot;)

```&lt;|end|&gt;&lt;|endoftext|&gt; 


Instruction 1:

Write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing two columns: &#x27;Name&#x27; and &#x27;Age&#x27;. The script should calculate the average age of the individuals listed in the file and print the result.


Solution 1:

```python

import csv


def calculate_average_age(csv_file):

    total_age = 0

    count = 0

    with open(csv_file, mode=&#x27;r&#x27;) as file:

        reader = csv.DictReader(file)

        for row in reader:

            total_age += int(row[&#x27;Age&#x27;])

            count += 1

    return total_age / count if count &gt; 0 else 0


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:

    csv_file = &#x27;people.csv&#x27;

    average_age = calculate_average_age(csv_file)

    print(f&quot;The average age of the individuals is: {average_age}&quot;)

```

Create safetensors using the following code:
```
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor

model_id= &quot;&lt;huggingface_model_id&gt;&quot;
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

model.save_pretrained(&quot;&lt;local_dir&gt;&quot;)
processor.save_pretrained(&quot;&lt;local_dir&gt;&quot;)
```
Then use the &lt;local_dir&gt; as the --hf-path in the convert script.
```
python -m mlx_vlm.convert --hf-path &lt;local_dir&gt; --mlx-path &lt;mlx_dir&gt;
