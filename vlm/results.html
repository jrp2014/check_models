The Shard, a modern skyscraper, stands tall and illuminated, its glass facade reflecting the night sky. The building&#x27;s unique design features a tapering shape that culminates in a pointed tip, which is particularly noticeable in the image. The lighting on the Shard creates a striking contrast against the dark sky, making it a focal point of the scene.

In the background, other buildings are visible, including the London Bridge Hospital, identifiable by its name inscribed on the facade. The hospital is a notable structure in the area, known for its modern architecture and medical facilities. The buildings in the background are a mix of residential and commercial structures, contributing to the urban landscape of London.

To the left of the Shard, there are two construction cranes, indicating ongoing development or construction activities in the area. These cranes are a common sight in urban environments, symbolizing growth and progress.

The image is taken from across the River Thames, providing a picturesque view of the city. The river is calm, with gentle ripples visible on its surface, reflecting the lights from the buildings. The sky above is dark, suggesting it is either late evening or early morning, with the stars not being visible due to the brightness of the city lights.

The overall scene captures the essence of a bustling city, with its modern architecture, ongoing development, and the iconic Shard standing tall as a symbol of London&#x27;s skyline.

# AI
 To find the number of divisors of a number, we can use the following method:

 - First, we write the number as a product of prime factors, using the smallest prime factor possible. For example, $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$.
 - Next, we use the fact that any divisor of $12$ must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b$, where $0 \leq a \leq 2$ and $0 \leq b \leq 1$. This is because we can only use the prime factors of $12$ in the divisor, and we can only use each prime factor as many times as it appears</strong></div></td>
