I&#x27;m trying to find the number of divisors of a number. For example, the number 12 has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

I&#x27;m looking for a general method to find the number of divisors of a number.

##

# Response
 To find the number of divisors of a number, we can use the following method:

 - First, we write the number as a product of prime factors, using the smallest prime factor possible. For example, $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$.
 - Next, we use the fact that any divisor of $12$ must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b$, where $0 \leq a \leq 2$ and $0 \leq b \leq 1$. This is because we can only use the prime factors of $12$ in our divisor, and we can only use each prime factor as many times as it appears in the factorization of $12$.
 - Finally, we count the number of possible values for $a$ and $b$, and multiply them together. This gives us the total number of divisors of $12$. In this case, there are $3$ possible values for $a$ ($0, 1, 2$) and $2$ possible values for $b$ ($0, 1$), so the number of divisors is $3 \cdot 2 = 6$.&lt;|end|&gt;&lt;|endoftext|&gt; # question

## How to find the number of divisors of a number?

I&#x27;m trying to find the number of divisors of a number. For example, the number $12$ has $6$ divisors: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$.
