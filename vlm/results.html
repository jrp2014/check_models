I&#x27;m trying to find the number of divisors of a number. For example, the number 12 has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

I&#x27;m looking for a general method to find the number of divisors of a number.

# # AI
To find the number of divisors of a number, factorize the number into its prime factors and use the formula $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\ldots$, where $a, b, c$ are the exponents of the prime factors in the factorization.&lt;|end|&gt;&lt;|endoftext|&gt; # question

# answer
To find the number of divisors of a number, factorize the number into its prime factors, raise each prime factor by one more than its exponent, and multiply these numbers together.&lt;|end|&gt;&lt;|endoftext|&gt; # question
