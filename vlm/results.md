\#\# How to find the number of divisors of a number?

I am trying to find the number of divisors of a number. For example, the number 12 has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

I am looking for a general method to find the number of divisors of any number.


\#\#

To find the number of divisors of a number, you can factorize the number into its prime factors and use the formula: if the prime factorization of a number is $p\_1^{a\_1} \\cdot p\_2^{a\_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p\_n^{a\_n}$, then the number of divisors is $(a\_1 + 1)(a\_2 + 1)\\ldots(a\_n + 1)$.<\|end\|><\|endoftext\|> \# user: \#\# How to find the number of divisors of a number?
