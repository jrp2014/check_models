## How to find the number of possible combinations of a given set of numbers?

I have a set of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

I want to find the number of possible combinations of these numbers.

For example, if I have 3 numbers, the possible combinations are:

123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 156, 157, 158, 159, 167, 168, 169, 176, 177, 178, 179, 186, 187, 188, 189, 196, 197, 198, 199.

I want to find the number of possible combinations of 3 numbers from the given set.


## Output

 To find the number of possible combinations of a given set of numbers, we can use the concept of permutations. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by the formula:

\[ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \]

where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

An 18th-century timber-framed Hiltinbury Granary stands elevated on staddle stones, preserving its historical integrity. The structure, part of the preserved Bursledon Windmill site in Hampshire, England, is set against a backdrop of lush summer foliage. In the foreground, a massive, weathered timber rests on the grass, likely a remnant of the windmill's machinery. This scene encapsulates the functional design and rustic beauty of rural English heritage.

Historic Bursledon Windmill Site: Hiltinbury Granary and Remnants of Agricultural Heritage

### Description
The image captures the serene and historic Bursledon Windmill site in Hampshire, England, on a warm August afternoon. The focal point is the Hiltinbury Granary, an 18th-century timber-framed building raised on staddle stones, traditional mushroom-shaped stone pillars used to protect stored grain from rodents and dampness. In the foreground, a large, weathered timber, likely part of the old windmill's machinery, rests on the grass. The scene is framed by lush summer foliage, highlighting the rustic beauty and functional design of rural English heritage.
