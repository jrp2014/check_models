A prominent gatehouse with a pointed archway dominates the left side of the frame, leading to a visible arched passage. The stonework features varying textures and some patches of moss and lichen, adding to its historical character. <br><br>The walls are topped with a crenellated parapet and feature small, arched windows with red lattice detailing. To the right of the gatehouse, a more solid section of the wall rises, with a smaller arched opening and a dark, recessed doorway. The roof of the gatehouse is partially covered in green vegetation, suggesting a long period of exposure to the elements.<br><br>The foreground includes a patch of neatly trimmed green grass and a paved walkway made of light-colored stone slabs. A black metal railing runs along the edge of the walkway, separating it from a lower area with more greenery and glimpses of what appears to be archaeological remains. Lush green trees form a backdrop to the walls, creating a contrast between the man-made structure and the natural environment.
