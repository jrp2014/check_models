For example, $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$.<br> - Next, we use the fact that any divisor of $12$ must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b$, where $0 \leq a \leq 2$ and $0 \leq b \leq 1$. This is because we can only use the prime factors of $12$ in the divisor, and we can only use each prime factor as many times as it appears |
