For example, the number 12 has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.<br><br>I'm looking for a general method to find the number of divisors of a number.<br><br>##<br><br># Response<br> To find the number of divisors of a number, we can use the following method:<br><br> - First, we write the number as a product of prime factors, using the smallest prime factor possible. For example, $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$.<br> - Next, we use the fact that any divisor of $12$ must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b$, where $0 \leq a \leq 2$ and $0 \leq b \leq 1$. This is because we can only use the prime factors of $12$ in our divisor, and we can only use each prime factor as many times as it appears in the factorization of $12$.<br> - Finally, we count the number of possible values for $a$ and $b$, and multiply them together. This gives us the total number of divisors of $12$. In this case, there are $3$ possible values for $a$ ($0, 1, 2$) and $2$ possible values for $b$ ($0, 1$), so the number of divisors is $3 \cdot 2 = 6$.<\|end\|><\|endoftext\|> # question<br><br>## How to find the number of divisors of a number?<br><br>I'm trying to find the number of divisors of a number.
