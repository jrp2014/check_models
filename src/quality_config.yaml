# Quality Configuration for MLX VLM Check
# This file defines thresholds and patterns used to detect quality issues in model generation.

thresholds:
  # Repetition detection
  repetition_ratio: 0.8          # 80% of tokens must be same to flag
  min_text_length: 10            # Minimum text length to check
  min_token_count: 5             # Minimum tokens to analyze

  # Verbosity detection
  max_verbosity_tokens: 300      # Substantial length threshold
  min_meta_patterns: 2           # Minimum meta-commentary patterns
  min_section_headers: 3         # Minimum section headers

  # Bullet point detection
  max_bullets: 15                # Maximum allowed bullet points

  # Generic output detection
  min_text_length_for_generic: 20 # Minimum text length to analyze for genericity
  generic_filler_threshold: 0.15  # Filler ratio threshold (15%)
  min_specificity_indicators: 2   # Minimum indicators for non-generic content
