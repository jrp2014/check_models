The user wants me to analyze an image and provide structured metadata. The image is of St Michael's Parish Church in Bishop's Stortford, England. The existing keywords and context are already provided, so I need to build on that.\n\nFirst, the title should be concise and descriptive. Since it's a church, maybe something like \"St Michael's Parish Church in Bishop's Stortford, England\". That's straightforward and includes the key location.\n\nFor the description, I need to cover key subjects, setting, and action. The image shows the church's exterior, focusing on its architecture. The context mentions it's a Grade I listed building with Perpendicular Gothic style, built in the early 15th century. The photo was taken on a cloudy February afternoon. The walls are flint-knapped and stone-dressed, with arched windows and a churchyard. The overcast lighting highlights textures and the building's historic presence.\n\nKeywords should start with specific subjects: St Michael's Parish Church, Bishop's Stortford, England, UK. Then setting: urban, outdoor, churchyard. Actions/activities: photography, tourism, worship. Concepts/themes: heritage, historic architecture, religious building. Mood: serene, solemn. Visual style: exterior, wide-angle, overcast lighting. Colors: grey, brown, stone, flint-knapped walls. Seasonal: winter, February. Use-case: tourism, travel, heritage site.\n\nI need to make sure the keywords are ordered from most specific to general. Also, include any new concepts or emotions not in the existing list, like \"serene\" or \"solemn\". Check if \"graveyard\" is relevant, which it is. Maybe add \"clock tower\" and \"weathervane\" from the existing keywords. Also, \"Perpendicular Gothic architecture\" is specific. Avoid repeating existing keywords but ensure all relevant ones are included. Make sure the title is exactly 5-12 words. Let me structure all this into the three sections as specified.\u25c1/think\u25b7Title: St Michael's Parish Church in Bishop's Stortford, England  \nDescription: A photograph of St Michael's Parish Church in Bishop's Stortford, England, showcasing its Grade I listed Perpendicular Gothic architecture with flint-knapped walls, arched windows, and a historic churchyard under an overcast February sky.  \nKeywords: St Michael's"}
