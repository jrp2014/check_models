The image shows the church with its architectural details, so maybe \"St Michael's Parish Church, Bishop's Stortford, England: Perpendicular Gothic Architecture in a Historic Churchyard.\" That's 12 words, which fits the 5-12 word limit.\n\nNext, the description: need to cover key subjects (the church, its architecture, the churchyard), setting (historic, outdoor, possibly rural or urban? The description mentions Bishop's Stortford, which is a town, so maybe urban setting), action (the church is static, so no action, but the light and atmosphere). The description should be 1-3 sentences. Let's structure it: \"St Michael's Parish Church in Bishop's Stortford, England, is depicted under an overcast sky, showcasing its Perpendicular Gothic architecture with flint-knapped walls and arched windows.

Since it's a church, maybe something like \"St Michael's Parish Church in Bishop's Stortford, England\". That's straightforward and includes the key location.\n\nFor the description, I need to cover key subjects, setting, and action. The image shows the church's exterior, focusing on its architecture. The context mentions it's a Grade I listed building with Perpendicular Gothic style, built in the early 15th century. The photo was taken on a cloudy February afternoon. The walls are flint-knapped and stone-dressed, with arched windows and a churchyard. The overcast lighting highlights textures and the building's historic presence.\n\nKeywords should start with specific subjects: St Michael's Parish Church, Bishop's Stortford, England, UK. Then setting: urban, outdoor, churchyard. Actions/activities: photography, tourism, worship. Concepts/themes: heritage, historic architecture, religious building. Mood: serene, solemn. Visual style: exterior, wide-angle, overcast lighting. Colors: grey, brown, stone, flint-knapped walls. Seasonal: winter, February. Use-case: tourism, travel, heritage site.\n\nI need to make sure the keywords are ordered from most specific to general. Also, include any new concepts or emotions not in the existing list, like \"serene\" or \"solemn\". Check if \"graveyard\" is relevant, which it is. Maybe add \"clock tower\" and \"weathervane\" from the existing keywords. Also, \"Perpendicular Gothic architecture\" is specific.
