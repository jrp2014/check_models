He had finally created a device that could capture the kinetic energy of the waves and convert it into a clean, renewable power source. His invention, the WaveGen, was a marvel of engineering, a sleek, black box that could be mounted on any structure along the coast.\n\n\nExcited by his success, Alex decided to test his W"}
