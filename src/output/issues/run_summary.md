GitHub links target the repository's mutable main branch; they resolve to this
run's evidence only once these artifacts are committed, and a later run's
commit supersedes them. Pin links to that artifact commit when durable issue
evidence is required.

## Full artifacts

Stale retained artifacts omitted because their timestamps fall outside this
run: `check_models.log`, `environment.log`.
