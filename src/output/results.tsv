Wait, but the image shows a coastal scene with Arthur's Seat, Firth of Forth, etc. Wait, the caption mentions Arthur's Seat, but the context says Gingerbread House? Wait, no, the user provided a caption that's supposed to be for the image, but the context says "The image relates to 'Gingerbread House, Morrison's Haven, Prestongrange, Scotland, United Kingdom, UK'".
