This January scene captures The Old House, a distinctive Grade II* listed Georgian residence dating to the early 18th century, standing alongside a row of charming period cottages. As dusk begins to fall, warm light glows from the classic sash windows, offering a welcoming contrast to the crisp air. The bare, gnarled branches of mature trees frame the view, while the moss-covered clay tiles on the rooftops speak to the buildings' centuries-long history. The scene, with its neat white picket fence and verdant lawn, encapsulates the timeless appeal of a traditional English market town.\n\n...
