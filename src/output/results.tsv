Should be specific, include location, date, time, building name, holiday lights, winter, twilight, etc. Should be suitable for cataloguing or searching. Provide a caption (short), a description (detailed), and keywords (list). Possibly also include alt text. The user says "Provide a factual caption, description, and keywords suitable for cataloguing, or searching for, the image." So we need to produce three sections: caption, description, keywords.
