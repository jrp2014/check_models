Background: row of hotels and apartments, typical of a British seaside town. Motion blur of car taillights: the cars in the background have blurred taillights, so that's correct. The area was developed during Victorian era, Hastings grew into a resort, image captures modern tranquil moment outside peak season. That's a historical note, but the context says "the image relates to...", so we can include that as part of the description.\n\nNow, the caption: need to make sure it's factual.
