Wait, no, the user says "Here is a caption for the image, crafted according to your specifications:" followed by two identical captions. Then they say "The photo was taken around 2026-01-17 16:15:42 GMT..." which is probably a typo, but the actual time is 2023-01-17 or something. Wait, the user says "Do not speculate.
