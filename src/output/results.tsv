The focal point is The Old House, a well-preserved Georgian residence from the early 18th century, which is a Grade II* listed building. The house features classic sash windows that emit a warm glow as dusk approaches, contrasting with the cool, crisp air. The building is surrounded by a white picket fence and a verdant lawn, adding to its charm. Mature trees with bare, gnarled branches frame the scene, and the moss-covered clay tiles on the rooftops hint at the building's centuries-long history. The row of period cottages alongside The Old House completes the picturesque setting, embodying the timeless appeal of a traditional English market town.\n\n...
