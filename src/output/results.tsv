The perspective is from a low angle, emphasizing the reflective, rain-slicked paving stones that stretch out in the foreground. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool, damp atmosphere typical of late autumn. In the distance, a row of modern hotels and apartments can be seen, indicative of the area's development and its role as a coastal resort. The presence of a car's motion-blurred taillights adds a dynamic element to the otherwise still and tranquil setting. The architecture and the wet pavement suggest a recent rainfall, and the overall mood is one of quiet and calm, with the potential for a bustling atmosphere during peak tourist seasons.\n...

First, the task is to provide a factual caption, description, and keywords for the image. The context is White Rock, Hastings, England, UK. The user provided a caption, but we need to make sure it's factual and specific, based on the image.\n\nFirst, the caption. The user's example is a bit long, but we need to stick to the context. Let's check the image: it's a seafront, damp, late autumn (so maybe early fall), overcast sky, rain-slicked pavement, hotels/apartments in the background, motion blur from a car. The location is White Rock, Hastings, UK. The timestamp is 2025-11-15 16:19:28 GMT, but since it's a future date, maybe that's a typo? Wait, the context says "around 2025-11-15", but the image is a real photo, so maybe the caption should be based on the image, not the timestamp. Wait, the user says "Do not speculate. Focus on visual content, drawing on any available contextual information for specificity."\n...
