# Generated Reports

This directory contains generated HTML and Markdown reports from running `check_models.py`.

The script's default output location is now this directory, keeping the project root clean.

## Files

- `results.html` - Styled HTML report (viewable in browser)
- `results.md` - GitHub-friendly Markdown report

These files are git-ignored and regenerated each time you run the tool.
