# Check Models Output Index

These models serve many purposes; this run probes exactly one narrow task:
producing catalogue metadata for a single photograph from the assisted-lane
prompt and whatever context it supplies — here, camera-recorded capture
context plus draft descriptive hints previously produced by a more capable
model. Results say nothing about a model's fitness for other uses.

## Run at a glance

- Usability: usable 13, usable with caveats 19, unusable 0, not evaluated 0
- Top observations: Unrecognised model control tokens remain visible (2), Conversation-role control tokens remain visible (1), Title or keywords do not meet requested constraints (16)
