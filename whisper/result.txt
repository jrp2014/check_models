 So Yaro, the thing that we have to do is behave as if we are sitting in a cafe, having a conversation.
 We mustn't think of this machine, just forget about it and talk to me as if I am your dearest friend and you're telling me your story.
 Don't think about this, otherwise you'll get all kind of tense and uncomfortable.
 So what I'd like to begin, my first question is, we are beginning to record your life story and what I'd like to know is, why do you want to do this and who is it for?
 Well, the idea is to know my children, where I came from.
 Yes.
 And...
 Yes.
 And that's basically it.
 Right, wonderful.
 So can I start now?
 Yes, so tell me how you'd like to begin.
 Well, I have to start from the beginning.
 Yes.
 At the beginning is where I was born.
 I was born in a little town in South Bohemia, which was called at that time Mezimosti upon Nejarga.
 Right.
 This name no longer exists.
 Because there were two towns, there were two rivers in South Bohemia.
 One is called Nejarga, the other one is called Lužnice.
 And they converged in one spot.
 And one half of the spot is called Veselý upon Lužnice and the other one is called Mezimosti upon Nejarga.
 For years I understand.
 They couldn't decide which one to choose.
 They didn't know which one to use because the Mezimosti thought that they were the most important.
 Yes.
 And Veselý thought that they were the most important.
 The Mezimosti, it's a very important railway, what they call it, hub.
 All the trains from the north, east and west, they all converged in this town.
 All right.
 And they all converged in this town.

 And they all converged in this town.
 And they all converged in this town.
 And because of this, the railways, they had their own offices, engineering offices for
 the checking of the track and repairs and so on.
 So they needed engineers.
 And my father was one of them.
 And the other thing was that...
 I think it was...
 I think it was...
 I think it was...
 The railway actually provided accommodation for the staff and for the engineers.
 So my parents, when they got married, they got a flat nearby, near the station.
 And in this flat we lived.
 And this is where I was born.
 What year was that, Jeroen?
 That was 1932.
 Wow, okay.
 1932.
 And...
 Were you the first child?
 I was the first child.
 And this flat was used also by my mother's brothers and sisters, who used to go quite
 along with her.
 And they had some way to study in Budějovice and Budvaise.
 And so they eventually had the pushbikes and went on train to Budějovice and they returned.
 They used the pushbikes to get them home to Drahov.
 So you mean that your mother's relations used to stop off there?
 On their way to places.
 On their way to...
 To school.
 Oh, right.
 So it was your flat, your family flat, but you were constantly being visited by your...
 Well, visited by my uncles.
 And so that was the situation.
 You used the address you put it in.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 One day there was a man standing outside chatting with somebody else and so somebody was giving me lift in front of my uncles.
 So I asked him to stop and I went to see this man and I asked him for permission to see my house.
 I said, look, this is my birthplace. How can I get in?
 And he said, this is my house, I live there. And he was very cooperative and he said, come with me.
 So off we went into the house and outside was his wife just sorting out some strawberries or something.
 And daughter.
 And daughter. And so I told him the story and they were very friendly and listening to me.
 And so they...
 So I saw the house which... or the flat rather, which was very simple and it's still very simple.
 And at that time when I was born, the lady or the house lady or...
 Housekeeper or...
 Housekeeper or the owner, I can't remember.
 It was somebody, some called Mrs. Bozdichowa.
 And the story, I don't remember this of course, but the story goes that this Bozdichowa obviously didn't like children very much.
 And apparently I was crying at night and waking her up and so she just threw us out.
 And so my parents, that would go somewhere else.
 It wasn't difficult to find.
 It was difficult to find them.
 And there was a house nearby overlooking the river Nezarka.
 And this is where we spent not very long because we were here from the rest of the story.
 We never stayed for too long anywhere because of my father's occupation.
 Oh yes, yes.
 Anyway.
 So my father, he lived...
 He lived at the station and surveying and repairing and looking after the...
 After the track.
 And I don't really remember very much.
 I don't remember in fact anything about the first flood.
 What I'm saying is just a tradition of people who have been doing it.
 But later on, my father always remembered my uncle who used to leave his bicycle in
 that house and said, poor Joseph.
 His name was Joseph.
 He...
 He...
 He...
 First of all, he had to go on the bike which was quite a long way from the village.
 And the village incidentally, it's called Drahov.
 And that's the picture.
 We've got it in the kitchen.
 And this is where my mother's family came from.
 And this is where we also settled in the end.
 So he meant, poor Joseph, that the journey was so long.
 Yes.
 The journey was so long.
 And then when he returned from school, so he arrived at the station and he was in the
 village.
 And he was...
 He was in the village.
 And he arrived at the station and took his bike and went home.
 Again, a long journey.
 And when he got home, they...
 You just couldn't relax because there was so much to do on the farm.
 So he would...
 They would give him something to do, to look after the cattle or horses or whatever.
 Yeah.
 And he was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was so fit.
 And then later when he grew up and when he finished the studies, so he went into the
 Czech Army.
 And he became...
 Eventually he became a colonel which was a very high position.
 Very high, yeah.
 Anyway, so...
 You could mention that he was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was very fit.
 He was so fit.
 He was known as Pepik.
 Well, we are talking about my life.
 That was him?
 Yes, he was called Joseph.
 And just for completion of this, the family's name was Marek.
 Like in English it's Mark.
 So this is Marek.
 And that was a very well thought of family in that area, in that district.
 And they were passing on, for instance, the mayorship.
 Oh yes, yes. Your mother's family?
 My mother's family.
 They had that kind of reputation?
 Yes, they had that kind of reputation.
 Wonderful.
 And they had six children.
 And?
 Yes.
 And the oldest always inherited the farm.
 My father, unfortunately, he wasn't the oldest.
 He was second oldest.
 So she had to marry my father who was the railway engineer.
 But that farm, that was really wonderful.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 I'd like to go there.
 She was the second child.
 And was the first child a boy?
 The first child was a boy.
 So did it matter whether you were a girl or a boy, whether you inherited the farm?
 Oh, it mattered very much.
 So if you were a girl and you were the first child, would you still have got the farm?
 Probably not, unless there was some crisis.
 Ah, yes, yes.
 But the son, you know, the oldest son, always became the farmer.
 And so in this particular case, that was my uncle.
 And I, you know, I used to, then I used to work with him on that farm.
 Because during the summer holidays and winter holidays and every time we had some school holidays,
 we didn't go anywhere to Greece or whatever.
 We always went to Drahov.
 The whole family?
 The whole family.
 Yes.
 And we were helping on the farm.
 Did you have the impression, when you were living with your mother, not in the country,
 that she sort of really missed country occupations?
 Well, we spent so much time there.
 So you felt she got the chance to...
 Yes, yes, we spent so much time in Drahov.
 In fact, we, my grandfather, you know,
 when they, my parents got married, my grandfather was still in charge.
 He was still the farmer.
 Because the son was, his son was young and wasn't married.
 And so, so he was on the farm.
 But the farmer was my grandfather.
 Right, right.
 And the grandfather, so he gave my parents a piece of land adjacent to the farm.
 Yes, yes.
 And the, and the photograph.
 And so my parents then built a little house for themselves.
 That was, and there were two reasons.
 One was so we could, we would have the opportunity to go somewhere in the summer.
 Mm-hmm.
 And secondly, my grandfather had the vision.
 That he would actually move there as well.
 Oh, I see.
 When he retired, you see.
 So what, how many rooms did that house have?
 Very few.
 But one, two, three, four rooms, four rooms.
 And, and your grandfather intended to go and live there?
 Yes, but it, that failed.
 Oh.
 He, he, apparently he moved, he moved in there and then we spent a week or something like that.
 And then, and then he, that was not his life, you see.
 Mm-hmm.
 Because he liked the farm.
 Yes.
 And he liked, he liked watching the farm and what was happening.
 Yes.
 And the farm was just something wonderful.
 You see, I remember it myself.
 Mm-hmm.
 Because in the morning, the, the whole place was buzzing with life.
 Yeah.
 So what was on the farm?
 What kind of farm was it?
 Well, that was very, everything.
 You got horses there, you got cattle there, you got pigs there, you, you got chicken there.
 Uh.
 Ducks?
 Duck.
 Geese.
 Mm-hmm.
 And what did they, the horses were for work?
 For work?
 So they were horses that pulled a plow or pulled a cart or?
 Yes, yes.
 That was, you know, to begin with.
 There had no trucks or anything at all.
 So the horses were for work?
 For work.
 So they were horses that pulled a plough or pulled a cart?
 Yes, that was to begin with.
 They had no tractor or anything at all and the horses were really essential to drive or to run the farm.
 So it was actually very fertile, that land. It could grow things.
 Well, it wasn't all that you couldn't, for instance, grow wheat.
 It wasn't very fertile. There was a lot of stone there.
 I remember it because I used to plough there myself later on when I...
 Sorry, I'm sorry.
 So when you ploughed, what did you grow?
 We'd grow either potatoes, flax.
 And rye. Rye was very popular.
 Oats.
 And did you grow those things for yourself or to sell?
 To sell both.
 You know, what was usable in the farm was used in the farm.
 But otherwise it was sold.
 You know, each farmer had a duty.
 To hand over something to the state.
 You got paid for this, but...
 But it was, especially during the war,
 there were fairly substantial duties for the farmers to give something.
 To provide.
 To provide.
 And Jero, did you have a sense of seasons?
 Because you had apple picking and cherry picking.
 I mean, was there fruit?
 You really could experience in your life what time of year it was because of what work you were doing.
 Oh yes, oh yes.
 For instance, even for the farming land,
 it's...
 In the autumn,
 all the fields were ploughed and cleaned and so on.
 And on some of them,
 we...
 We put grain or, you know,
 whatever it was actually decided to grow there.
 But as I've said, the land was rather poor.
 And...
 That was one of the reasons why, not in this farm,
 but when you looked around, you will notice there are lakes everywhere.
 And the story goes that the reason for starting these lakes was because the land was so poor.
 And it was preferable to, or more profitable to rear fish.
 And so they built...
 And that was in the Middle Ages.
 1500 and that kind of thing.
 Did you have a fish lake?
 We didn't have a fish lake.
 But they were everywhere.
 And what kind of fish? Was it a particular kind?
 Carp.
 Carp, all carp?
 Carp.
 And they also...
 They combined the fish.
 The main was carp, of course.
 But because carp is considered a lazy kind of fish.
 So to keep it moving, they would put a pike.
 They would run out to pike into the pond.
 To keep them on the ball.
 To keep them on the ball and to keep them moving.
 But Jero, did you feel that your grandfather...
 Had a real relationship with how to look after his land properly so that it didn't...
 He was really...
 First of all, he had the education.
 You know, he went to the high school in Bad Vajs.
 Where he, first of all, during his time, that was just German speaking town.
 Although it was Czech.
 And so this is where...
 Where he learned German.
 Right.
 And he...
 I lost my...
 You said he had an education?
 He had an education in farming.
 So he...
 The modern methods.
 Modern methods and so on.
 And he was a really wonderful man.
 He...
 How he looked after the farm.
 But also how, you know, he's intellectual.
 He was...
 He was very, you know, very, very high.
 Sort of at a high level.
 This is why he became the mayor of the area because...
 Did you feel he was cultured?
 He was cultured.
 Yes.
 Yes, he was.
 And he was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 He was a very good man.
 Did you feel he was cultured?
 He was cultured, yes, yes he was. But it was, I wouldn't say he had some education like
 in university. It was all the education, it was all aimed towards the farming. So he would
 know what to grow, how often to grow things. The sequences. The sequences, you just can't,
 really nearly you have to be, there is a certain order.
 How to rotate things so that the land didn't get too overworked.
 Did you feel that he had an understanding of weather? Because those old farmers, they
 used to be able to come out and look at the clouds and...
 And tell you the weather.
 Yes, yes, yes, he certainly had. And he was, I had most, we got very close. I, and he,
 later on when I sort of grew up and I was able to help on the farm more sort of, for
 example, I was, I got the task to drive the tractor, the tractor which was in those days,

 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 the horses so it was all mine you see i had to feed them i had to clean them and then i had to
 go with them you know whatever it was yeah necessary so so you became somebody who could
 be around those big creatures and feel at home you weren't afraid or no i wasn't afraid no no no no
 but they knew me of course you know the horses knew me after after all this and uh but the horses
 were they were not the heavy ones and then but they were not the light ones they were sort of
 in between in between and they could well there was really wonderful horses
 they did so much so much work and in the beginning before before uncle
 it was actually uncle and he inherited the farm so he started modernizing this so he bought a tractor
 and he just can't imagine this even when the tractor tractor arrived in drav that was the
 only tractor in the whole village everything stopped and they all all the other farmers
 came to look at it i should say that you know the geography of these villages there
 it's something quite different to the british farm you've got a just solitary farm or nothing else
 in the all the all the villages it's really a
 quite a number of farms of various sizes gathered in the same village
 so how does that work that they all have different kinds of crops or they all have different kinds of
 some are doing fish and some are doing different crops and and so they don't
 step on each other's toes they create a sort of multi the the land is all being used for all
 its different yes they each of these farmers some of them are quite small really yeah they're very
 strong so they they would they would uh uh grow whatever they could manage on their land they
 They came in from the land.
 So they had to get on.
 Oh, they had to get on.
 Because they were also near each other.
 Oh, yes. Oh, yes. But it was such a happy ...
 Although my grandfather, he was, let me say, the richest one.
 Yeah.
 And there were some of them very, very small,
 like this chap who became the priest
 and who is still sort of .
 Yes.
 So they had ... He came from the same village,
 but the farm they had was very, very, very small.
 Today, nobody would even look at it,
 but they managed ...
 I don't know how many children they had,
 and despite all this, they managed to live.
 They could look at it.
 They could look after the children.
 They were looking. Yeah, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 So I just want to add here,
 we're talking about a man who was a close friend of Jaros,
 who he knows now, whose name is ...
 Lennart Gulhaneik.
 And we'll talk about him more later,
 just so that we get that clear.
 Okay. You could put in a sentence
 that you were driving the tractor when you were 15,
 and that will give it a date.
 But thank you.
 I think that'll be on there.
 So, Jaros, your grandfather was a well-to-do farmer,
 and he ended up being the first tractor owner,
 and not only was he the first tractor owner,
 you got to drive it.
 I got to drive it.
 And you didn't even know how to ...
 I mean, you were 15, so you didn't know
 how to drive a car or something.
 Did you just have to work that out together, or ...
 Well, I was watching them. They were ...
 I watched them before that, you see,
 because the tractor was there, and Uncle was driving it,
 and I used to sit beside him and just ...
 Oh, yeah. So you learned on the job.
 I learned on the job, and we ...
 I liked the tractor, and also I liked ...
 You know, it was part of the agriculture,
 and I just remember that once, suddenly,
 I was with this uncle, and we were in the middle of the field,
 and Uncle stopped, and he said,
 You tried, and so I did, and from that time,
 I was driving the tractor every day.
 So you were somebody he really trusted.
 Oh, yes.
 Because it was very expensive, probably.
 Oh, yes, but it was. It was.
 Talking about this tractor, it was a German-made.
 It was a firm called Deutz, and so the tractor,
 as I said, it derived, and the whole village was upside down,
 and ...
 But I didn't know all the circumstances
 of the supply of this tractor,
 but I remember that one year later,
 a man came with this ladder, all this, and he had some ...
 Mm-hmm.
 Uh ...
 luggage, and he derived various instruments, and so on.
 And he ...
 So he asked where the tractor was,
 and then he actually took that tractor apart,
 measured the tolerances everywhere, wrote it down.
 He was German, you see, and ...
 Today, nobody would bother, but in those days,
 that man actually spent the whole week there,
 just checking that tractor.
 So was it like the tractor was having its medical?
 His medical? Yes.
 And did they do that every year?
 That he ... Yes, but later on, of course,
 the war came, and it disrupted everything,
 but to begin, all this was before the war started.
 Yeah, yeah.
 But I'm just wondering how things have changed.
 Today, you go and buy a car, and who cares?
 And also, it's all ...
 And did they do that every year?
 Yes, but later on of course the war came and it disrupted everything.
 But to begin with, all this was before the war started.
 But I'm just wondering how things have changed.
 Today you go and buy a car and who cares?
 And also it's all computerized so nobody can mend it anyway.
 That's right, we aren't even forbidden to do that.
 But Jero, have I interrupted you?
 Sorry to interrupt.
 No, no, no.
 You had that experience on the farm with your family coming so often to help and it was
 a joyful time for you.
 Did you find it hard to go home and get back to school and all that kind of thing?
 Or did you also like your home life?
 No I liked the farm, really.
 It was hard for you?
 It was very hard for you to leave the farm.
 It was very hard to leave the farm because as I've said, I always get the sense of achievement.
 If you drive just a tractor, a very simple tractor, you're behind.
 I was plowing for instance.
 And you see the result of what you've done.
 Whereas at school, I just went there and we were just following around.
 And I liked the farm.
 And the whole life around the farm and with all the, you know, I got to know all the other
 sons.
 Not my sons.
 But you see each farmer like from this and this.
 Chapu became the priest.
 But we were in the evening after the whole work.
 We were in the evening.
 We were in the evening.
 We were in the evening.
 We would go and in front of the church there was a little flat area where we would play
 football.
 And so we would play football and then we would go home and that was it.
 Or went to cinema.
 Went to cinema.
 But…
 Was there a cinema in the nearby farm?
 No.
 Well it was in the nearby village.
 What was the first film you ever saw?
 The first film I ever saw was the first film I ever saw.
 The first film I ever saw.
 The first film I ever saw.
 The first film I ever saw.
 The first film I ever saw.
 The first film I ever saw.
 I can't remember. The first film I ever saw was Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
 Do you know that that's my father's first film he ever saw?
 There you are. It was my first film.
 And so were you quite little when you saw that?
 Oh yes. I must have been six maybe, I don't remember, that kind of age.
 And so...
 And Jero, can I ask, when you were there on the farm, did everything stop on Sunday except for the necessities?
 Yes.
 And you had a proper festival?
 Yes.
 So there was working week.
 Working week.
 Saturday and Sunday was?
 Saturday was the whole forenoon.
 And in the afternoon we...
 Sometimes cleaned the...
 You know, we had brooms and we swept the floors so the farm would look...
 Maintenance.
 Maintenance.
 Yeah.
 But there were some exceptions.
 Sometimes the weather was not very good.
 And sometimes it was raining and raining.
 And it was just during, say, hay harvest.
 At the time there should have been hay harvest or any harvest.
 And it was raining.
 And it was impossible to go into the fields.
 And suddenly on Sunday morning the sun came out.
 And that was the time where we would go and work on the farm as well.
 You broke the rhythm because it was necessary.
 It was necessary.
 But otherwise, otherwise if the weather was behaving properly...
 So what did you do on Saturday night?
 Was it the beginning of relaxing?
 Saturday night?
 Yeah.
 Because it's hard work.
 You know, getting up early, doing all that work.
 And then maintenance all Saturday.
 Well, it never actually occurred to me that I needed any relaxing.
 I needed some rest and so on.
 I never needed it.
 You just loved your life.
 I loved my life.
 If anything on Saturday evening I would go with my lads and play playing football in front of the church.
 Right, right.
 And we always...
 The church has a vicarage in it.
 It's still there today.
 Yeah.
 And to get into the vicarage there was an enormous gate.
 A wooden gate.
 And if you kicked the ball against the gate there was an enormous bang.
 And we loved this because the priest always came out.
 And told you off.
 To us often wondering what was happening.
 Well that's not very nice, Jero.
 So you were not only good, you were also a vandal.
 No, we never damaged anything.
 It was just healthy pushing the boundaries.
 Pushing the boundaries.
 Yes.
 But Jero, on Sunday how did the day go?
 On Sunday?
 You were Catholics and...
 Yes, we were Catholics.
 And so we would go to church of course.
 Every Sunday without a failure.
 Rain, no rain.
 Snow, no snow.
 And did you have special clothes for that?
 Oh yes.
 There was special clothes.
 You dressed up.
 Dressed up.
 And that was the clothes which I wore only on Sundays.
 And then when I returned from the church I took it off and put it between the wardrobe.
 So you were allowed to...
 It's not like in Woola where my grandfather was brought up.
 That on Sunday nobody was allowed to do anything that was considered play.
 They weren't allowed to read novels or they had to be...
 No, that was not that kind of regime.
 It was peaceful and people were chatting and...
 Socializing.
 Socializing and...
 Visiting each other.
 And the lunch would be always different.
 There would be meat on Sunday.
 And special...
 Whereas during the week, talking about the food, you see that this food was very, very
 simple.
 And it was always based on potatoes because that was the potato land or country.
 And I remember that was where we got the land.
 My parents and...
 So beside it there was a field where they grew potatoes.
 Early potatoes.
 So we had really fresh potatoes from the July or something like that.
 And my grandmother, she had a hoe and a basket and every lunchtime she would go there and
 dug up some of the potatoes, brought them home and then he cooked.
 So she...
 So tell me what you had...
 Tell me the sort of menu.
 I'd love to know the menu.
 Well, I'm just coming to it.
 The menu was extremely simple.
 Breakfast?
 Breakfast was always what they called a coffee, but it wasn't coffee really.
 It was...
 Substitute coffee.
 Substitute coffee.
 Or it was...
 Chicory?
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 Roasted chicory.
 or roasted rye.
 Oh, rye.
 And so you got this liquid,
 and then a loaf of bread.
 Baked by the baker, or baked by you?
 Baked in the house.
 By us.
 That was also...
 But you see, that was a bread
 which lasted, say, a fortnight.
 So once in a fortnight, my grandmother,
 she had an office,
 how do you call it?
 Mixing bowl?
 Mixing bowl.
 And she would...
 She always left something there,
 so the yeast would be there
 from the previous baking.
 And then she put...
 It was a very simple flour.
 But the bread was always...
 rye bread.
 And so she would make a little row of...
 a row of loaf.
 Yeah.
 Did she not make a big three-kilo loaf?
 She never weighed.
 Yeah, I know, but she made a big loaf.
 Well, they were quite big.
 And they were sort of stuck up
 in one of the...
 There was one special room.
 Oh, yes.
 The loaves were stuck up,
 one beside each other.
 And anyway, for breakfast,
 you got a slice of this bread
 and butter.
 And that was it.
 And it was made on the farm, the butter?
 Of course, yes.
 It was made on the farm.
 And was the rye grown on the farm?
 Yes.
 Wow.
 So they were really
 more or less self-sufficient.
 Yeah.
 And they had meat also.
 They would either have the...
 It would be...
 Pig or a chicken.
 Well, pig...
 For a pig, you had to go to the butcher,
 but the butcher was always rather exceptional.
 And did you take your own pig to the butcher?
 Yes.
 You took your pig to the butcher
 and he slaughtered it?
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
 He would go to the butcher
 and he would cut up...
 It could have been from anywhere.
 Oh, I see.
 You didn't keep pigs?
 Oh, yes.
 Yes.
 But you gave them to the abattoir?
 You gave them to the butcher
 and the butcher would take it
 and whatever, cut it in bits,
 and then you would sort of
 slaughter it to the people around.
 Okay, so he bought your pig, in other words.
 He bought our pig, yes.
 Can I just have a check?
 Yes, please.
 Okay.
 And this grandmother of mine,
 she always...
 The meal was different, really.
 It was from the same basics.
 And what she managed to do was really wonderful.
 It was so...
 Can you just tell me some of the lunches?
 Well, the lunches...
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 I think I've got to say,
 Can you just tell me some of the lunches?
 Well, the lunches, that was also based on potatoes.
 And she would put in various sort of shapes, different shapes.
 And with the lunches, again, we would have bread and butter.
 And the butter was not salted. It was just bread and butter.
 And you drank with this the milk.
 But the milk was...
 It was not...
 As it came to be, it was not...
 It was not from the cows.
 It was made to be sour.
 Fermented?
 Fermented. Fermented.
 So was it like thin yogurt?
 Like thin yogurt.
 Because that's the only way you could keep it.
 That's right.
 Without it going bad.
 Yes. And so we would eat and drink with it.
 And were there vegetables with the potatoes?
 Yes.
 Cabbage or...
 Yes, they would have carrots. They would have cabbage.
 And... but it's... you know, the variety was really poor comparing it to today when you go to the supermarket.
 There are so many different...
 That didn't exist.
 And nobody actually wanted to...
 Nobody was sort of pining for anything more.
 Sometimes, talking about drinking was the milk.
 But sometimes it was also the beer.
 Because this is basically, you know, the Czech beer country.
 And so they...
 Grandfather would give me a...
 I put back in my wooden bucket.
 A jug or...
 A jug.
 And send me...
 Because in that little village there were three...
 Three pubs.
 Oh, yes.
 But the...
 The beer was very weak.
 That's about...
 The beer was very weak.
 But also the owners of these pubs were also the farmers.
 You see, so he was farming and he was...
 So...
 So that's like you hear about in Shakespeare.
 Yes.
 That people drank with their meals small beer.
 Yes.
 It's called...
 It's very weak beer.
 So the children could drink it.
 It's very weak beer.
 Yes.
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 And the...
 You could get lemonade, but we never drank this because it just didn't suit the weather.
 And were there, in the house that you were living, was there running water and hot and cold water and heating?
 Well, we, in that new house, there was a well, so there wasn't really running water.
 There was a well still there and a pump that was pumping the water into the reservoir in the loft.
 And so you got water from there.
 So what happened when it was winter and everything was frozen?
 Well, that was the problem.
 If it was too cold,
 you just chopped it in smaller, you melted it in the stove.
 And was the loo inside the house?
 The loo was, yes, was inside the house.
 And was there a bath with a tap that went from the loft?
 There was, in the bath, it was very primitive.
 You see, the bath was very, very primitive.
 Even in that new house, I would say, the house we had.
 So did you heat the water and put it in the bath?
 Yes.
 So things like, do you mind if I ask you these details?
 No.
 Because it's kind of interesting.
 Because it's very amazing because you're kind of telling us that you lived,
 you had an experience as a child of a world which is completely past.
 Yes.
 And people lived on the land and cut their coat according to the circumstances.
 That's right.
 And they didn't have any of these kind of soft luxuries.
 No.
 So when you woke in the morning and you washed and you, was there just a jug in your room?
 A jug in the room, yes.
 So you just washed and went to the bathroom and then arrived at breakfast and you were given coffee and...
 There wasn't even a bathroom.
 It was in the room that they, when we eat.
 And this grandfather and grandmother, they slept there, they had two beds there.
 And so they really basically, when they retired, they lived in that single retirement room.
 There was another room beside it that was for guests if somebody came.
 So they would put in the coffee and they would go to the bathroom.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 And they lived in that room.
 in that single retirement room.
 There was another room beside it that was for guests,
 if somebody came, so they would put in there.
 But they, first of all, because of the heating,
 which is in the winter, you needed,
 you should be able to warm it up,
 so they had this little room,
 and as I said, the grandma slept there,
 a member of the grandfather slept there.
 And if I came, for instance, I would sleep,
 they would put me on a little couch, and I would sleep.
 And was it a wood-burning stove?
 Yes.
 And was it covered in tiles?
 Yes.
 Pretty.
 Pretty.
 Oh, and that's still there?
 It's not there.
 Not there anymore.
 They ruined the house completely.
 They made it modern.
 But the family still lives there.
 Your family still lives there.
 My sister lives in that house, which...
 Parents built.
 Which parents built.
 So my sister and her husband, and their daughters,
 and granddaughter.
 They still live there.
 But it was, the right thing, that was designed by my father,
 who was an engineer.
 But he just came from his own farm.
 And so it was all very primitive.
 So the house that he built was identical, you see.
 That was, I mean, today, it's very old.
 It's very old.
 It's very old.
 And today, they had a bathroom.
 But that was added.
 You know, when I was small, in that bathroom,
 we didn't have it.
 Never used it.
 Mm-hmm.
 And it was...
 But when you, so, sorry, but, so you got up in the morning.
 You were actually sharing a room.
 You washed with a jug of water.
 Oh.
 Did you clean your teeth with toothpaste or with salt, or?
 With toothpaste.
 With toothpaste.
 So there was, so you cleaned your teeth in that little bowl,
 and then threw the water out somewhere.
 Yes.
 Was there a special place to throw the water out?
 Into the field.
 Just into the field.
 And then everybody got dressed and ate this very simple breakfast,
 and went off to the fields.
 And did you take something to eat in the fields if you got hungry, or?
 Well, that was all provided, you see.
 You just, you never took anything with you.
 Because grandma,
 at about 10 o'clock, she would, you could see her from the distance.
 Mm-hm.
 And, and she was loaded with breads and butter and, and milk or beer or whatever.
 And so, and she was shouting, it's a.
 Snack time.
 Snack time.
 Good.
 So we stopped and sat around for five minutes and ate the bread and drank whatever.
 And then we went back to, to, to the field to, you know, to work.
 Ah, so everybody was looked after.
 Everybody was looked after.
 Mm-hm.
 Then suddenly you could hear a bell ringing from the church.
 Yeah.
 That was the signal it was 12 o'clock.
 That was the signal they should go back for lunch.
 Great. So there's a very amazing community, actually.
 It was a community with a real rhythm.



 Yeah.
 It was a community with a real rhythm.
 Yeah.
 It was a community with a real rhythm.

 It was a community with a real rhythm.
 Yeah.
 It was a community with a real rhythm.
 It was a community with a real rhythm.

 Yes.
 That everybody communicated.
 Yes.
 So then you went back to lunch and you would… in what room was that?
 It was the same room as the beds.
 Yes.
 So people were really… so there was a big table put out or…?
 There was a big table put out, depending how many people would come back.
 The farm workers also got their lunch.
 And you all sat together, the farm workers and the family?
 Yes.
 And they were all living nearby in little cottages or…?
 Well, some of them had their own house in the village.
 They just came to help for the…
 Have you got the sun in your face?
 Yes, I have.
 Shall I…
 I'm all right now.
 Okay.
 So you would all trot along to lunch, feeling extremely hungry.
 Yes, and then we had lunch and then we would go back to the field.
 But that lunch was made out of potatoes and vegetables and milk and beer to drink.
 Was there any protein?
 Cheese or eggs or…?
 Eggs, maybe.
 But even that was…
 That was…
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 But they might have had an egg soup.
 Yeah.
 So this potato, is it turned into things like rosti, like they have in Switzerland?
 Was it baked?
 Was it mashed?
 Was it whole or…?
 But it depended.
 You know, there were so many varieties.
 Different ways of cooking potatoes.
 Yes.
 And are those recipes still used in Czech Republic?
 In the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 And are they still used in the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 And are they still used in the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 And are they still used in the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 And are they still used in the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 And are they still used in the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 And are they still used in the Czech Republic?
 Yes.
 I don't think they were...
 I mean it's amazing that there's so many different ways to cook potatoes if you always
 felt they were different.
 Did she use different herbs or...?
 Sometimes it was mashed, sometimes it was half mashed, so you know, sometimes it was
 whole, baked, whole, whole, but they just peeled off the skin.
 And then there was a butter, the butter was local.
 Did you use salt and pepper?
 We never had pepper.
 Salt, yes.
 But pepper, never.
 And did you sometimes have cream cheese?
 Yes.
 And...
 Yes, yes, we did have that.
 Yeah.
 Because that's quite a famous meal, potatoes and cream cheese, isn't it?
 Yes.
 And spring onions.
 That's good.
 Spring onions.
 So did you... you never got bored of this menu?
 You just felt hungry and happy?
 No, I never got bored because it was always so tasty, I thought.
 Oh, wonderful.
 So she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 And she was a really good cook.
 Yes.
 Oh wonderful, so she was a really good cook. I just want to make sure this is near.
 And then so then you would all, nobody had an afternoon rest?
 No, we, no because it was the time of the harvest, so the time was very precious.
 Yes, you just went and worked again.
 So we went to the fields and three or four of us, my grandfather and my grandmother again came with
 baskets loaded with beer and this was the second break.
 And that was bread and the same thing always?
 Yes, it was bread and butter.
 Right, right. No jam, no honey?
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no jam.
 And not honey?
 No honey.
 And then so then you worked until the sun went down?
 We went, well you couldn't,
 because
 the cattle you see had to be attended to.
 Oh yes.
 So when the time came then when the cattle, it was about about five, six o'clock in the
 evening, so everything stopped and people went to attend to the cattle.
 Did that mean bringing them in and milking them?
 Well the cattle, they had,
 they didn't bring them in, they were always there.
 You know they never like here, they are in fields, not in there.
 They were all in stables.
 Oh always.
 Cowshed.
 They were never put in fields?
 Never.
 And was the cowshed quite roomy with fresh straw and?
 Well you had to change it every evening.
 All right, so it was really kept clean and looked after.
 Kept clean and you did it twice.
 You did it twice.
 You did it twice.
 You did it twice.
 You did it twice.
 First of all early in the morning and then late in the afternoon or in the evening.
 And how many, sort of like ten or five or?
 They had forty, I remember they had, my grandfather he had forty cows.
 Girl cows.
 And then did he used to put them out to a bull in somebody else's field?
 So they all had cows.
 Well he had, because he was, he was the top, so he had his own bulls.
 And they actually, all the other farmers were coming to him.
 Ah.
 So then, so those cows, forty cows would all produce calves, which all had to be calved.
 And then the milk is being drunk by the calves and then, so you had, then the calves were sold or?
 The cows, the calves, the calves in most cases were sold.
 And so, so somebody had to milk?
 Forty cows in the evening and the morning and muck out.
 Yes, that was all done by the women.
 But that's huge, much work.
 Yes.
 And that's what the women did?
 The women did the milking?
 Milk, yeah they did the milking.
 And I remember one of my aunts, she was a bit of a joker.
 And she was always spraying, like, the milk into my face.
 And she was very, I remember this very well.
 And like Yarrow Whitton?
 Yeah, what happened to all that milk from forty cows?
 Well, they were glass.
 And so the milk was put into the jars and somebody came and was taking.
 Yeah.
 Unless it was milk which was needed.
 Yeah, so you kept some of your house and then you gave, you sold it.
 Yes.
 And it went into the towns.
 And it went into the towns.
 So somebody came in the morning and the evening to collect milk.
 Yes.
 And in the summer, when it was the summer, you had to collect milk.
 And it was so hot, was it put into refrigerated lorries or?
 It didn't exist.
 It was just loaded.
 You had to be so differently organized without having all these things that you make things.
 You didn't have a fridge in the house, you just had a larder.
 No, no fridge.
 And I remember outside the house, there was a fridge.
 And outside there was a little trough.
 And there was all the cats.
 Because the cats had to get some milk as well.
 Because they were looking after the mice.
 And they were useful.
 So, but when you finished all the cow business, you all ate supper again?
 Yes, I had a very good supper and then I went to play football.
 And the supper was potatoes again?
 Yes.
 Wow.
 Isn't it amazing?
 So it was really seasonal.
 Was there oil of any kind?
 No.
 Butter?
 Butter, yes.
 And fat, pork fat?
 Oh, lard. Lovely, tasty.
 Lard, yes.
 Because usually the pigs are slaughtered in winter.
 So it was glassed.
 It was put into glass jars, the meat?
 The meat as well. It was conserved.
 So there wasn't hanging pork which dried?
 No, no.
 Was it cooked before it was put in the jars?
 I think it was.
 Yes, I think it was.
 And do you remember your grandmother having a herb garden?
 Yes, she had a little garden and so she would grow some herbs.
 And that was the only thing I remember.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 And I remember my grandmother had a little garden.
 Or chicken. They had a lot of chicken, so very often they prepared the chicken.
 So that would be the day before she had cut some poor chicken's head off.
 And then what did you have with the meat? Was it a bit different?
 Potatoes.
 More potatoes. And did you have more vegetables and pudding? Or cake?
 Cake, yes. They would bake cakes.
 Just for Sunday?
 Just for Sunday.
 And that would be after Sunday lunch? And also for visitors?
 Yes, maybe on Sunday evening if they make too many cakes.
 So basically the people living on this island,
 Yes.
 on this farm with you, where you were staying, they had to be very capable.
 Oh yes.
 And very hard working. You didn't sort of have a headache and go to bed or something, did you?
 Oh no.
 You kept...
 Not at night.
 You jolly well kept going.
 I kept going.
 But did you ever experience people working on these farms who weren't actually farmers
 and who actually wanted to lie in bed? I mean, did everybody just sort of fit in and pull
 themselves together?
 Everybody just fit in. But we, I'm talking about my family, our family.
 Yeah.
 So we really spent all the time just on the farm.
 Yeah.
 But there were exceptions. You know, there was a season of strawberries in the woods,
 in the woodland.
 Berberis?
 Berberis. And this was something I hated.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated it.
 I hated. Strawberries and bilberries. But I, because of the woodland full of mosquitoes,
 millions of them. And so I prefer to go to the field with my uncle and...
 Be out in the warm sun where you weren't being bitten. I remember how terrified I was when
 my mother in the morning came out with a bucket that was intended to be filled with
 fruit, with the strawberries, you know the black. Yes, yes. You need millions of them to fill it up.
 And so we could spend the whole day in these fields. And there were no sprays against
 no sprays. So when you got, basically your mother decided every morning whether you would be
 in the forest or in the field, you just did what you were told. Yes. You weren't allowed to say to
 your mum. No, no, no. Please can I go in the field? You did what you did. I did what I did. But then when I got sort of stronger and so that was the field always. Because they needed you. They needed me. I was so glad because I didn't like the strawberries. Because of the mosquitoes. And also you know you were to pick a small thing. Yes. And did you have mushroom picking? Yes. But I was
 never very good at, I could never see them. I was so high up and I could never see them.
 But you know there were some people who, you know some of them are so mad. They went with
 torches. To get the first mushroom. Early in the morning. On their knees. Sort of crawling.
 And was that because you could sell them and earn quite a lot of money?
 No. They liked eating them. They liked eating them.
 Yeah, yeah. And they dried them for winter.
 So did you have a kind of seasonal menu as well? Because when it was strawberries then
 they all had to be bottled and but you also. Well they were used for the cake. It was a
 flat cake like a pizza. But instead of meat there were bilberries on the top.
 Oh yeah. And it was a sweet cake.
 So they would put cream and sugar you see and that was like a pudding.
 But you only had those things at seasonal times?
 Yes.
 And all the fruit that was bottled, was that just used in the winter?
 That was used in the winter.
 Yes that was put in the summer.
 So in the winter when you couldn't do lots of stuff in the fields, you had animals to
 look after and you couldn't really get to the fields because of the weather. So what
 did the farmer do? Or what did he do?
 Well not a lot. For instance all the helping hands who helped, for instance in our farm.
 Employed people.
 Employed people. So they went home because that was their seasonal work.
 Seasonal work. That was their holidays.
 But how did they survive? What did they live on?
 Well they got paid.
 But when they were away in the winter and. . . ?
 Well they got paid.
 Because they still get paid.
 Oh, so you looked after them?
 Yes.
 They worked like slaves during the growing and harvesting season and then they had a break?
 Then they had a break.
 And your uncle and everybody, when they weren't all working, what did they do?
 Well, there was plenty to do.
 Cutting wood for the cattle.
 Looking after the cattle.
 Right.
 In the morning they had to get up very early and in the evening.
 And the other thing was making fuel.
 Because you couldn't go and buy coal or anything.
 Oil and...
 Part of the farm was a piece of wood, woodland.
 Oh yes.
 And so we used to go there and cut some of the trees, pine trees.
 So did you have beautiful wood piles?
 All around the house?
 Yes.
 Against the wall or...
 Against the wall.
 Underneath.
 So the wood pile was like, it really had to be looked after otherwise people would be
 freezing.
 That's right.
 And that still goes on in Germany.
 I've noticed that.
 But can I just ask you, did you, did anybody ever read or what did you do when it was somebody's
 birthday or when there was a wedding or a christening or...
 Oh, there was a...
 If there was a wedding, well, that was a different, different program altogether.
 The wedding, if it was happening on that farm, so the largest room was utilized by
 the wedding.
 You see, and there would be tables stacked up and, and people would be sitting there
 and drinking and chatting and...
 And there was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 There was a lot of...
 So no messing around going to Prague for a...
 No, no way.
 Life was...
 Back to normal.
 You had to look after the world and you couldn't mess around having breaks.
 When you mention Prague for instance, you see although when you are there today,
 you see Prague from that village, it's only 60 miles or something like that.
 If you have a car, you are there and back in no time.
 But it was a major undertaking to go there.
 Because there was no train station in the village.
 There was no train station.
 Were there buses?
 Later on, but to begin with there was nothing.
 So people, the universe was the world which they could encompass with their own imagination
 and with their own capacity to walk or use a foot.
 So the universe was complete and boundary.
 Boundary, yes.
 And that had a...
 So if you needed something special like needles for sewing or...
 Well, you could, if you needed something very special, you would have to go to Budweis.
 Or near was a town called Jędrzyków Radec.
 Or in Germany called...
 Or Neuhaus.
 Oh, Mercedes.
 So did that happen like once every two months?
 There would be a sort of journey to go and get the things that you couldn't like matches or...
 Yes.
 Things you couldn't make yourself?
 Well, it's for some matches.
 There was a shop in that village.
 Oh, there was a little grocer which sold...
 Little grocer and he would be selling this kind of things.
 Matches.
 Yes.
 And...
 So did he...
 So that man who had that little grocer shop, he sold the necessities that the people needed.
 Yes.
 But he didn't sell food because people had their own food.
 No.
 No, he was just selling just the bare necessities.
 And was he a local?
 He was a local.
 And he had decided not to be a farmer.
 He probably inherited it from his farmer.
 The shop went from family to family.
 So, Jarro, after you'd eaten Sunday lunch and...
 Well, do you remember thinking this is exciting, it's meat and it's...
 Did you remember the feeling of celebration that it was something nice and...
 You were a boy so you weren't that interested or...
 I never...
 We never actually celebrated anything.
 That was a certain flow of life which we followed.
 And...
 And...
 And...
 And...
 The celebrations just never came to an end.
 It could have...
 When there was a wedding, but then there was a celebration.
 Birthdays?
 Or...
 Both?
 Both.
 Birthdays, no, and then nothing.
 But then you have a...
 A religious...
 There is a church.
 There is a church in Drahov.
 And it's in this concert hall.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 And it's a church.
 consecrated to Holy Mary. And when the time, the day of Holy Mary came, so there was a big
 fate, you may say. And they would cook better and they would eat better.
 All together in a community or alone in your house?
 Alone in the house, but...
 It was a special day.
 It was a special day, but each of these little communities had their own celebrations, you may say.
 But what did you do, for example, at Easter?
 Oh, at Easter we would... well, it was a special time, where we would go...
 Did you have fasts? Did you Lent? Did you do Lent? Where you didn't eat...
 Yes, oh yes.
 For the whole of Lent, no meat?
 No meat. Well, there was no meat anyway, so it didn't...
 But on Sunday...
 On Sunday you wouldn't have it either?
 No. So there was not much... not much different. But there was also always this work in the fields.
 There was always something to do there, you see.
 But you didn't have Easter eggs?
 Oh yes.
 So on Easter day...
 Which is not always... is it always a Sunday? Oh yes, it was a Sunday.
 Did you children get... have an Easter egg from this work?
 Yes.
 And it was chocolate or was it real eggs?
 Real eggs? No, no chocolate.
 Hard boiled...
 Hard boiled eggs, yes.
 Real eggs which had been dyed? Colours? Or...
 They'd been dyed, and you could get some stickers with the areas, nice pictures.
 Oh yes.
 And so you... you know...
 And your own skins.
 And my own skins, yes.
 Did you kids get help to make those eggs?
 Oh yes.
 Was that... so... I mean, do you remember feeling excited by that or...?
 Oh yes. It was a different time. It was... that was a different time. It was...
 And then the local boys from the village, they formed a group.
 And they walked from one village to the other.
 And they were singing...
 Something which today would be considered racist.
 And... about Judas.
 So what was the song?
 And Jews and...
 Can you remember... can you tell me what the song said?
 This was the song that was especially sung at weddings.
 No, no, this was of Easter.
 Oh this was Easter.
 So this was a group of boys who had a choir.
 And they would go from church to church at Easter.
 And they would go from... not from church to church...
 From house to house.
 From house to house.
 And they would sing this...
 Uh...
 You unfaithful...
 Judas.
 Judas.
 Judas.
 What have you done?
 That you...
 Betrayed your master and...
 And for this...
 you will suffer. And then the next verse of the Jews, unfaithful Jews, like the black dogs, dug a hole for Christ.
 And buried the Christ. But against Jews you would never sin.
 But did you know any Jews?
 Oh, there were Jews. There were Jews in Bohemia.
 But were they in the tent, really?
 But the Jews were not being looked.
 They were being looked upon very kindly, I must say.
 Did the Catholic Church preach that?
 No, no, no. It had nothing to do with the Catholic Church.
 Different people?
 Different people. And they were sort of known for lending money for a big interest.
 And so, if you don't mind me asking, you mean that just you didn't know any Jews,
 but you gathered in your mother's milk a picture of different kind of people who were not quite trustworthy because they exploited people?
 Yes. But when I say I knew them, of course I knew them because they had in the nearby town, Mezimoski.
 This is where I was born. So they had shops, for instance.
 Or pubs.
 Or pubs.
 Or selling things. They never worked like farmers or anything.
 They weren't allowed to own land, Jews.
 I don't know if that was allowed or not.
 Yes, that's one of the things. That's one of the reasons the Jews did what they did, because they weren't allowed to own land.
 I never knew that.
 It was in the Middle Ages. There were laws made.
 But so, do you remember, so the shops, did the Jewish shops have different things in them, but they weren't in other shops?
 Well, they, I remember one shop, they were selling cloth.
 Clothes.
 And clothes.
 Did you actually feel prejudice against Jews?
 No.
 It was just something that people talked about.
 It was part of the scenario. They were prejudiced.
 It wasn't an emotional thing for you?
 No.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, Yaro, at Easter time, do you mind me asking these questions?
 No.
 So, at Easter time, there was a special service?
 There was a, well, Easter started not on Easter Sunday, but about three days before that.
 Thursday, Good Friday.
 Friday.
 Oh, yeah.
 And Saturday and during, there was special, and they still are in now, in Czechia.
 Yes.
 Washing the feet.
 Monday, Thursday, washing the feet.
 Washing the feet, and it still goes on.
 And then Friday was the crucifixion, and were you allowed to work on that day?
 Oh, yes.
 You had to work.
 You had to work.
 Because they said, again, depending on the weather, and I remember once, I went with
 my wife.
 Oh, yes.
 I went with my uncle.
 We were sewing, old-timey clothes.
 This is a huge field.
 And I got the task, uncle, uncle had horses, and I was one mile walking behind this machine,
 sewing machine.
 Yeah.
 And then, then he gave me something to, a piece of stick, and at the end of the stick,
 he gave me a piece of a stick.
 At the end of the stick was a hook.
 Because there was a danger, the machine would pick up.
 Get clogged up.
 Yes, pick up.
 Pick up.
 Stones and.
 Stones and.
 Wheat.
 Wheat.
 Wheat.
 And so I remember one day we walked, and you know, I just came from school the previous
 day.
 And I was walking.
 And I was walking.
 And I was walking.
 And I did it.
 We walked the whole day, up, down, up, and up, up, and down, and chopping it up with,
 and that was for oats.
 Yeah.
 What did you keep the oats in?
 Because here they had different bags and things.
 Well, they had sacks, sacks.
 Sacks.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sacks?
 Yes.
 And you carried the sack on the...
 Well, they were in the... the sacks were in the middle of the field somewhere and so the
 machine ran out of the seats.
 So we went there and then brought it and tucked it up.
 But towards the end, when we actually finished, I was so tired.
 I just couldn't move because, especially if you walk, the field was soft.
 You have to spray it, fresh it out.
 And... but I did it.
 So you didn't spray the seed by hand.
 That was the machine in front of you.
 It was the machine.
 See, right.
 And when you'd finished that day's work and you were so exhausted and you just kind of
 stopped.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 You were so exhausted.
 That's very interesting, isn't it? That that was the thing that you saw even as a small child.
 That's very interesting.
 Yes, because you went there and you saw, well, at Easter there was nothing here and I was just trying to figure out the wheat out.
 And then you come and it was all this iron.
 And your family is very, I mean I have the impression from reading your story about your father that it was quite unusual to read about a man who had such a deep religious faith.
 So although you were all working so hard, did you experience around you that the people had a deep religious faith?
 That they weren't just going through the motions, they actually really believed in God.
 Yes, they did.
 And so they really cared about church.
 And they cared about the church.
 They cared about the festivals.
 So at Easter time is the resurrection of Christ.
 It's the most important thing.
 I mean, did you have a special greeting on that day like in Russia where they say Christ is risen?
 No, we, well, Christ is risen, the priest said at the altar.
 But otherwise we wouldn't, there was nothing actually very special.
 You didn't have special food on Easter day?































 No, we didn't have special food.
 We had fish.
 We usually had fish on Fridays.
 Ah, yes, so you did keep those traditions on Friday.
 We kept these traditions.
 Yeah.
 But otherwise during Easter time and so on.
 And we had fish at Christmas of course.
 Did you go to your grandfather for Christmas?
 No.
 We always had, well it was a bit complicated.
 We would have our Christmas meal and we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 And we would have our Christmas dinner.
 We always had, well it was a bit complicated. We would have our Christmas meal and someone at home in that little house. I was just sharing my parents.
 Later, we actually stayed in Prague because it was so cold. You couldn't travel. You just couldn't travel and it was so cold.
 And even to warm up the house, I remember entering the house during the winter time. It was so cold. It was like being outside.
 Like being outside. Yeah.
 And so you...
 You put the fire on and it went on but then it was such a long time that by the time the house got warmed up...
 You were dead. You were dead. You were an icicle.
 What you didn't mention before when you were washing in the morning, you always had cold water. I don't believe you heated up any water.
 We never had any. We had... We had honey water but...
 Cold. Cold.
 And did you have a wash day? Was there a wash day that your grandmother did? That it was one day that she washed everything?
 Yes.
 And what happened when it was raining?
 That's the way.
 Did she just hang it in the barn or...?
 No, she never... I found her there. I don't think... It was just...
 It was just... It was one. The weather was really so bad.
 And did she wash by hand and then roll it... put it through a thing and...
 Yes, yes, yes.
 So it was a huge job.
 Huge job. That's right.
 And you were all farmers so you're absolutely filthy. And you were wearing wool to be warm?
 Yes.
 I mean it's incredible labour. The life had such... Did you have bees?
 We had some bees, yes.
 And was that a woman's job?
 No, it was man's job. The women never had anything to do with bees. But no, we had... This is why I like honey to this day. I learned it from that time.
 What did you eat honey with? When did you eat honey? On Sunday?
 Well, the usual slice of bread with butter and honey.
 On Sunday?
 On Sunday.
 And did you have orchards?
 Yes, we had orchards.
 And plums?
 Plums, apples, cherries.
 Yes. But that Drahov, you know, the land is rather poor and so the amount of food was fairly limited.
 But you got... We usually went to get some more food.
 My father's farm.
 My father's farm.
 You know, my father also came from a farm. But it was near Tomko Pilsen.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 On the Pilsen Beers.
 Yes.
 And the land in that part of the country is very fertile.
 Right.
 So they...
 Had lots of trees and plums and that also.
 Beautiful, beautiful plants.
 Pears.
 Pears. And we were always invited to go there and help ourselves in the autumn.
 In the autumn.
 To help with the picking and then bring them back to the other farm.
 So you must have had unbelievable larders filled with fruit and places where all the apples were so they didn't go bad and...
 Yes, they were on little wooden...
 In the barns? Were there special barns where you kept everything stored? I mean...
 In the cellar.
 Your gran... I mean, was there a larder in the house or was it...
 Cellar.
 We had the cellar. It was cooler. So we would have shelves there and the fruit would be just...
 People would be sitting down beside each other on the shelf.
 And you kept the honey there as well?
 We kept the honey there.
 So you must have had lovely larders filled with home...
 Oh, yes.
 Wonderful things.
 Well, when you said this, you see people are always talking about the war.
 And how badly people were and so on. I don't remember this at all.
 Because you had people on the land who could give you things.
 We had. We had everything. We had butter and we had meat from some...
 But I didn't really feel or pine for meat.
 Ah, yes.
 And when we get pine, it was a bonus.
 And...
 So I...
 I think we were... No doubt we were better off than the English here.
 Yeah. People who lived... I noticed that lots and lots of people say that if they were related to some kind of country, community, they never experienced any rationing really. They got what they needed.
 Well, that was our case.
 Yes.
 And that part of the Czech Republic.
 Yes.
 Today it's different, but at that time, it was solely agriculture, land, area.
 So everybody had someone who...
 Yeah. Who could give them food.
 So, yeah, the reason that that place was making beer, was that because they were growing
 hops?
 They... No.
 No hops.
 They were... Hops are in the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 In the northern part of...
 in the northern part of the media but in that there was no no hopes but the main reason first of all
 is the weather and in the summer we just can't as i said before we just can't drink lemonade or
 something like that you have to drink beer but the beer that it was brutal was really so low
 so you could drink it the whole day and then you didn't hear anything it's just the taste
 so can i just ask you you know so basically what i'm getting from this conversation is that there
 was this childhood where the paradisical side of your childhood was going to this farm and the kind
 of joy of work and seeing achievement and then being able to play with it and then you know






 play with your friends and you became part of a community of boys where you had friends
 and you had this amazing work and your family were, they were responsible, reliable, trustworthy
 people so that the childhood, you felt in your childhood there are adults who know what's
 right and wrong and you were held in a kind of structure and form and it was a good time.
 That was an excellent time.
 Right.
 Very good time.
 And how many years did that go on that you were allowed to have that childhood?
 Not many.
 It just sounds much longer than it actually was when I think of it.
 Because childhood is forever.
 It has the quality of eternity.
 The magic world of childhood.
 That's right.
 That's the special thing about childhood.
 Yes.
 No, no, no.
 They did.
 It was something so unbelievable.
 So how old?
 So happy.
 Yeah, yeah.
 You see, and even today I go there and could sit in the garden and listen to the quails
 and that's all.
 Listen to the?
 Quails.
 Quails.
 Quails.
 The birds.
 Yes.
 So?
 Oh, yes.
 I've got three there, you see.
 And so when I go there I sit in the garden of this.
 Oh, yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.

 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.

 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Meanwhile your parents are producing children, you're going to this farm whenever you can,
 but you're having to be at school and your dad is moving.
 I'm just coming to it.
 I told you that I was born in that town called Mesimos,
 and that the landlady didn't like children and I was making a big noise and she couldn't sleep.
 So she told us to go.
 And so we went, my parents.
 It was still in the same town and we couldn't go anywhere else because my father had work there,
 you know, with the railways.
 But there was a house and...
 and the house is still there and when I go there I look at it.
 But we didn't stay there long either.
 We could... maybe one year at the most.
 And then my father was transferred to another town, another railway.
 And that's called in Czech Jindřichov Hranice.
 Noj house.
 Oh yes.
 But even there, and this is on the railway station, my sister was born.
 We got a flat there, you see.
 She doesn't...
 Above the waiting room there was another floor.
 And there was a flat, so...
 But we didn't stay there.
 So my sister was born there.
 But...
 They somehow, the railways, they needed my father somewhere else.
 So she...
 So he was commanded to go north of...
 The town is called Most, M-O-S-T.
 Mm-hmm.
 It also means bridge.
 Bridge is...
 It was in Sudetenland.
 Mm-hmm.
 And then the Germans took it away.
 And then...
 But...
 We...
 My father wasn't there long either.
 Then they somehow took Kranjsi away, but...
 And he was transferred to Prague.
 So we always followed him, you see.
 And so...
 How old was he?
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 He was...
 And then after a while, I don't know for which reason, but we moved from that flat
 to another one.
 I think it was bigger or two more.
 So did you stay in Prague then?
 Did your father get to be able to stay in one place then?
 Yes.
 From then on he was stable?
 He was stable.
 He was promoted and he got a job at the Ministry of Transport.
 And he then, so we didn't need to move anywhere.
 He made really big progress and in the end he was really the leading railway engineer
 in the whole Czech Republic.
 So like...
 Like father, like son.
 A very successful engineer.
 Yes, he was certainly a very successful engineer.
 Even when he retired, the other engineers came to consult him and ask him questions
 and so on.
 But when you lived in that flat, was there a garden?
 No.
 Was there a park?
 No.
 No.
 If you wanted to go somewhere else.
 That was such a difference.
 This is why we went to Drau.
 Every time there was some school holiday, we went.
 There were two reasons.
 One was because it was much better and secondly, the railway tickets for us were extremely cheap.
 You know, he got my father because he was...
 So he got...
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 He got a lot of money.
 You know, he got my father because he was... so he got preferential tickets.
 And did you often... you usually leave your father behind when you went on those journeys?
 He had to stay at home and be a worker?
 Yes, he stayed behind, except in the summer. Then he had his annual leave.
 So then he came and joined us in the...
 And was that about three weeks or...?
 That was about three weeks.
 Ah, yes. But Jarro, when you were in Prague, living in that house, how many babies were born?
 How many children did your parents have?
 Well, no one, only two. Me and...
 Oh, you only two? Oh, I thought there were more.
 So there's you and your sister, living in that house, and did she like going to the country as well?
 Yes, she did.
 And she also worked hard?
 She did, yes. She was keen on horses.
 I think she's stopped.
 Yes, I think it's a suitable time to stop.
 What age did you go to school?
 I was six.
 Ah, and then how many years younger was she than you?
 She was two years younger.
 Okay, so you were quite close.
 Yes, yes.
 And did you attend the same school for the whole of your education?
 No. To begin with, you know, the primary school, we went to the same school, of course.
 Could you walk there? Did you walk?
 Oh, yes.
 And then you go to the gymnasium?
 Then I went to the gymnasium.
 And her? And your sister?
 She also, she went to the same gymnasium.
 Oh, wonderful.
 And...
 Well, I went to the gymnasium eight years.
 And so did my sister. So did my wife.
 But she went to a different...
 You see, the communists then made changes.
 They somehow... I don't know. I've got my own views about why we were...
 By the school, the gymnasium I went to.
 Mm-hmm.
 All schools down.
 And I had to go somewhere else.
 And so did my...
 So did Agnes.
 How old was that, were you, when you had to change schools?
 Well, I was in sixth...
 After six years.
 So... 15?
 I was around 15.
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 Well, it was 1948.
 48.
 From 30 to...
 From 30 to...
 Right.
 Mm-hmm.
 And I have my opinion. I'm not quite sure if it's right or not.
 But there was a big hoo-ha in that particular gymnasium when the communists took over.
 Uh...
 Because suddenly a man appeared.
 He was one of our students.
 And he took charge of the whole so-called revolutionary...
 What do they call it?
 Education?
 Or was it activity?
 Activity.
 Oh, yeah.
 Revolution.
 And he wanted to start this revolutionary movement there.
 And we were all against it.
 And eventually he had to leave, you see.
 And that was really fun.
 It was a fiasco.
 And I think that the communists took...
 Took it as a sort of...
 Signal.
 And closed the school down.
 Yeah.
 Because that was in February 48.
 And the school lasted until the end of that school year.
 But the next year I was...
 I was transferred to another...
 To another...
 To another school.
 And I was...
 I was transferred to another school.
 But it was the same quality of school.
 Oh, yes, it was.
 Yeah.
 And your sister went there as well?
 No, she went to a different school.
 And she went to the same school Agnes went to.
 And I went to Lushenik.
 Right.
 So they...
 They really...
 I think that was the purpose, you know, to dispel the students.
 To stop you being all together and supporting each other in...
 Yes.
 In real life.
 Yes.
 And I think that was the purpose, you know, to dispel the students.
 To stop you being all together and supporting each other in...
 Yes.
 In real life.
 Yes.
 And I think that was the purpose, you know, to dispel the students.
 To stop you being all together and supporting each other in...
 to despair the students.
 To stop you being all together and supporting each other in resistance.
 I'm sure this is what I've got to do.
 And do you think that boy who tried to get you all involved in the revolutionary...
 Do you think he was sent in by the communists?
 I think he was.
 And then he didn't succeed and so they broke you up.
 Yes. Because it wasn't just a coincidence, I think.
 He was planted there.
 There was one classroom where we used to do drawings and paintings and so on.
 It was the largest room in the whole school.
 And this is where actually this meeting took place.
 And that was bad when I think of it now.
 But you actually, by then, you'd experienced the Nazis trying to brainwash you.
 And now you had the communists.
 Yes.
 So, Jaro, I think maybe it's a good idea to stop.
 To stop.
 But I think it's a good thing that we're doing this by talking.
 Because there's so much to tell, isn't there?
 It's just amazing.
 Does it feel good to talk?
 Yes, it does.
 Am I going to just stop this?
 Stop it.
 So you were explaining?
 I was explaining because it was just the beginning of the Second World War.
 And that was still Czechoslovakia existed and so on.
 And that was in 1938 when there was the Munich War and things like that.
 And so the Czech government obviously were worried.
 So they organized a mobilization.
 They mobilized the whole army.
 And my father was sent to the Czech Republic.
 And my mother was sent to Slovakia.
 His job stopped and he was suddenly in the army.
 And he was in Slovakia.
 And the reason why he was in Slovakia, because he was, at that time, he was part of the bridge building unit.
 Oh, yes.
 And so he went there.
 And my mother went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 And she went to visit him.
 She didn't have at that time, I'm sure she didn't have, because it was in November.
 Had you been sent to your grandfather's from that time?
 Yes.
 So she could go and visit your father, and she could leave you at home with her parents?
 Yes, yes, yes.
 Okay.
 Okay, let's stop.
 Goodbye until after Christmas.
 So today is the 27th of April, the birthday of Robert and the name day of Yarrow, and
 it's 2015 and we are beginning the second session of Yarrow's Life Story.
 So dearest Yarrow, we began by talking all about your amazing, exciting youth on the
 farm, and maybe what we should talk about is not only the things that you really had
 a good time doing.
 But what was school like?
 What were you doing when you weren't in the holidays?
 Well, this just brings me to the year 1939.
 Oh dear.
 Where the war started really, and where the Czechoslovakia was invaded by the German troops.
 And because of this, the Czech government declared a martial law, and it, how shall
 I put it, mobilized the whole army.
 And my father, he was in the army.
 He was in the army.
 He was in the army.
 He was in the army.
 He was in the army.
 He was in the army.
 He was in the army.

 He was in the army.

 He was in the army.
 He was in the army.











 as a sort of, not as a regular soldier, but just as a sort of reservist.
 Oh yes.
 And he was actually in a regiment which was dealing with bridges across the river Danube
 and Bratislava.
 And so, and this is where the regiment was actually permanently based.
 So when, he was called immediately to go there.
 So he packed everything and my mother was in a state, and anyway, he just, he went to
 Slovakia to Bratislava.
 And I still have it.
 I still have some pictures from various exercises.
 They, I remember they were building pontoon bridges and I think several months before
 that, or a year, the president, the Czechoslovak president Masaryk visited that.
 It had nothing to do with the Second World War.
 But it was just, he just came to have a look and, and so.
 And anyway, so coming back to the war, the Czech army was mobilized and my father was
 there and my mother was very, very unhappy.
 And he, she even went to, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the,
 to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the,
 to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, to the,
 go there and visit him by train.
 And I remember how she came back with various sort of small dishes with Slovakian motifs
 on them, which we still have, or my sister has.
 So when I go there I can still see it.
 Well, in the end, as the history tells you, nothing actually happened.
 The Czechoslovak army was dissolved.
 Was it defeated or dissolved?
 There was no fighting.
 The Czechoslovak army never fought, which, truly said for me, they didn't show any

 sort of form of resistance.
 And as the story or the history says, the president, the previous president was Benes.
 And after the Munich agreement and so on, he immediately resigned and went to London
 to live there.
 He went to live there in London.
 Did he capitulate?
 He didn't.

 He was a German.
 And he was a German.
 And he was a German.

 him and threatening him and asking him to sign some agreement about handing over Czechoslovakia
 to the Germans.
 And eventually he did.
 And that was the 15th of March 1939.
 So it was a kind of bloodless invasion.
 Bloodless invasion.
 But what really amazes me today is how well the Germans were organized.
 They must have known and they must have felt.
 Because the same day, as I've said, the whole thing was signed after midnight 1939.
 The following morning the Wehrmacht was in the city of Leningrad.

 The Wehrmacht was in the city of Leningrad.
 The Wehrmacht was in the city of Leningrad.
 The Wehrmacht was in the city of Leningrad.

 The Wehrmacht was in the city of Leningrad.
 the German army already crossed the Czechoslovak frontier
 and went straight to Prague,
 and there are photographs of Hitler being in the Prague castle,
 overlooking Prague and so on, so it was all very quick,
 and what happened is that the Czechoslovakia
 was sort of canceled or dissolved,
 and Slovakia became independent,
 and the Germans formed, they called the Czech part,
 Bermen und Mören, which is Czech and Moravia,
 and under this type, this country survived
 the whole of the war.
 war and at the end of the war of course it just went back to the name of Czechoslovakia.
 But when the bloodless overtaking of Czechoslovakia happened and the German soldiers came and
 made their presence felt, did they then do awful things?
 Did they shoot the soldiers and…
 No, no, no.
 The Czech army was simply dissolved and they just went and worked somewhere.
 He was a bricklayer, he just went back to be a bricklayer and that kind of thing.
 There was no physical fighting and there was no real demonstration by the Czech population
 against the German.
 There are only photographs from Prague when the German army came.
 They had these BMW motorbikes and so on.
 Some people were sort of showing the fist.
 But that was all.
 That was all.
 But what actually happened later on in 1936?
 No.
 It was 1941.
 You see the real ruler of the Berman, of the Bermen was…
 Heinrich.
 Heinrich.
 A terrible man.
 Yes.
 And he was, he was actually based on the castle.
 Yes.
 And he was actually the ruler, not Hacher.
 Hacher was still, you know, on the paper.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 On the paper Berman and Bermen was a democratic republic.
 Yes.
 And he was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 He was a puppet.
 across the Republic and so on, headed by Hacha and so on.
 But he was just a puppet.
 He had no power at all.
 The real power was with Heydrich.
 And Heydrich,
 Heydrich had an office at the Prague Castle.
 And he-
 Is that called, what is that called, that castle?
 Prague Castle.
 It's just called Prague Castle.
 It's not called Charles?
 No, no, no, it's just called Prague Castle.
 And Heydrich lived,
 we had some villas, some very beautiful house,
 the outskirts of Prague.
 And he was commuting and he had this Mercedes car and so on,
 and he was commuting to Prague every day
 from his house and so on.
 And that was his mistake, that was his fault.
 A coup.
 According to Hitler later on.
 Because the car was open, there was no roof,
 and there was nothing at all.
 Every time he used the same route.
 And the route actually took,
 you know, from the northern part of Prague,
 and there was a road, the road is still there,
 with a very sharp bend.
 And,
 this Heydrich, he was a nice, nasty man,
 and his plan was actually to get rid of the Czechs,
 and to ship them to Siberia,
 and to move the German inhabitants,
 or population, into Bohemia.
 Mm-hmm.
 And this is what the Czechs, of course,
 didn't like and took.
 So,
 what happened was that here in Britain,
 Danish, that was the previous president,
 he somehow organized several Czech parachutists
 who got trained here in,
 in, in, in, in,
 in, where was it, further up?
 Not in Britain.
 Mm-hmm.
 But in Britain.
 Mm-hmm.
 And,
 We'll remember. If we keep talking we'll remember.
 Yes, well I can hear it every day at least once, the name.
 Anyway, there were three Czech parachutists or soldiers who got trained in this camp, which is still here.
 If you go by car, the name is actually commemorated by a statue of these soldiers.
 Not only the Czechs, but the whole world.
 Anyway, the Czechs were loaded on an aeroplane and overnight taken to Bohemia and dropped.
 And their task was to get rid of Heinrich.
 Yes.






















 Yes.








 Yes.




 Yes.
 night taken to Bohemia and dropped and their task was to get rid of Heinrich, which they
 did.
 They blew up the car or they just shot them?
 They blew up the car but they blew up Heinrich because it could have ended in a complete
 disaster because the first one had a machine gun and the aim was to shoot him dead, to
 shoot Heinrich dead.
 But when he pressed the button nothing happened and the machine gun just didn't...
 Failed?
 Failed completely.
 So his deputy, the second one, fortunately he had a hand grenade with him so he tossed
 it into the car.
 And it didn't work.
 It did go off, exploded and Heinrich got injured and taken to the hospital and then he died.
 But were the soldiers killed?
 No, the soldiers were not killed.
 The soldiers hopped on a bicycle and just drove away and it took some time before...
 Well, the Germans of course...
 The Germans of course were up in arms and they were after them.
 And eventually they caught up with them.
 And they discovered that they were actually hiding in a little church in Prague, which
 was a Russian Orthodox church, which I happen to know because my school was just across
 the road.
 And so...
 And one of these...
 So the story goes that one of these parachutists actually shot them, you know, the Czech soldiers,
 and told them about the hiding place of, you know...
 And so the Germans, of course, they went there and...
 But it wasn't so simple.
 Because they had...
 They had...
 Suddenly their machine guns must have worked and so the Czech soldiers were firing back.
 And the church was surrounded by the German Wehrmacht soldiers and today there is a window
 in the wall and half the Germans were shooting and you can see better actually.
 The bullets.

 the Prague fire brigade and they came with loaded with water and so on and they
 could push the hoses with water into into the cell where the parachutists were.
 And that was the end. They died? Yes, well they killed themselves. Did they shoot
 themselves? They shot themselves. Because they knew they would be tortured
 horribly. Yes, but it says how they actually, it must have been a terrible situation how
 the water was rising in you know in that room they were hiding and eventually when it was
 too high so they shot themselves. But that was not the end of the story because after
 this the Germans took a terrible revenge.

 Reprisals. Reprisals. And many many people, you know it was good enough if somebody in
 pub or somewhere said we agreed the assassination of Heydrich they would have been shot on the
 spot. You see, so many, I don't know the number and so on, but many Czech people were actually
 executed or killed.
 I don't know the number.
 or killed by the Germans.
 Jan Ró, do you feel that you were still nevertheless glad that they had done the assassination,
 even though it was meant for Faisal's?
 Yes, in your... yes, I was glad because he was really a terrible man.
 Yes.
 And everybody knew, everybody knew who he was and what his plans were.
 And so, and true enough, you see, after this, you know, the threat that all the Czechs would be evacuated
 and moved on to the east, that suddenly disappeared.
 But of course then the war took a different...
 The Germans stopped being so successful and so they had to shelve their plans.
 That's right.
 So do you think that the murdering of, or the assassination of Heinrich actually helped the Czechs not to be evacuated from...
 Yes, I'm sure, I'm sure it did, yes.
 But Jero, could I ask you about yourself? How old were you then?
 Well, I was very young. You see, I was seven or eight.
 And how many children were there in the family?
 Two.
 You and your sister?
 You and my sister.
 And you were the oldest?
 I was the oldest.
 And were you living in Prague?
 Well, we were living mostly in Prague, but also we were living in South Bohemia, in Drahov.
 In that nice house that your grandfather gave you.
 Yes, yes.
 And was your father working for the railways?
 He was working in the railways, but by that time, when all this was happening, he was already, he was promoted.
 And he worked actually at the Ministry of Transport.
 And did that mean that he was experiencing his ministry was actually being run by the Germans?
 And he was actually having to do what they said?
 Yes. Well, he had nothing to do with the military.
 Yeah.
 He was a civil engineer, like myself.
 And his job was really to supervise and to look after the Czech railways.
 And did he, did they all have to speak German?
 They had to learn to speak German.
 And did they have to say Heil Hitler?
 Yes. So did I.
 When I, you know, I was, as I said, I was eight or nine years old or seven.
 And I had to do our lecture, every lecture at school.
 The professor would come and stood in front of us, in front of the blackboard.
 And he said, now we will, we will do.
 Salute Hitler.
 So we did. Heil Hitler.
 And then.
 Did you know it was horrible? Did you?
 Oh, of course.
 So did you, did you go home?
 And talk about what you really felt, even though in public you had to.
 Well, I just, I just don't know what, how we did.
 But this was very, you couldn't trust anybody.
 Because if somebody said, you know, he said this, that person would have been shot on the,
 there were no, no trials or nothing at all.
 That happened immediately, you see.
 So.
 There was for, for example.
 On, on, on, on the farmhouse.
 Which, when my uncle took over from my grandfather, when my mother was born.
 So, my uncle, he was, he was a farmer.
 But he was also the mayor of the village.
 And, and so he was really an important person.
 And then there was quite a lot of paperwork and some of which he couldn't do because he was in the fields.
 So he employed one man from, from the village called Heytmanek.
 And this, this Heytmanek was filling forms and writing things and, and so on.
 And the other thing I remember is that he was disabled, and so he walked with walking sticks and so on.
 And he said something somewhere.
 And one morning he came to work, as usual, and the Gestapo were waiting for him.
 And they packed him up and took him to a nearby town called Tabor.
 And there he was shot.
 There was no judge or nothing at all.
 And to these days, you know, my uncle was extremely lucky that he wasn't shot as well,
 because he was our author, he was the boss of that man.
 And had they...
 Have you even heard him saying something?
 There was some...
 That's a very complicated story, which I still don't understand.
 He was somehow involved in some letter which was sent somewhere,
 and which shouldn't have been sent, and so on.
 And this hate monarch, Ludva, Ludva hate monarch, was called.
 And he...
 He somehow...
 Sent a letter where he shouldn't have been.
 That was...
 You know, it was very simple.
 And he was shot on the...
 The same...
 Can you imagine?
 In the morning he went to work, not suspecting anything.
 And in the end he was already dead.
 It's awful.
 Did he have a family?
 No.
 So it was kind of like a reign of terror.
 Yes, it was.
 Did you experience as a child that it was frightening?
 Yes.
 Did you actually were afraid?
 You felt...
 You were aware that this was a day of...
 You know, the whole atmosphere in the whole country
 really was very, very sort of...
 Because suddenly you didn't know whom to believe.
 Yes, yes.
 And, Gerold, do you...
 Did you continue to go to church?
 Oh, yes.
 Nobody was told they couldn't go to church or anything like this?
 No, no.
 The church was free.
 And the church was not...
 They were sort of persecuted by the Germans or nothing of that kind.
 So...
 Did the priests help?
 Did they talk about what was going on?
 Did they comfort the congregation or...?
 No.
 No.
 It was all very dangerous because the Germans were really very good and skillful organizers.
 And they also knew how to tempt people against each other.
 Mm-hmm.
 And so I remember this, how...
 I remember one sort of scene that happened at home suddenly early in the morning.
 The bell rang.
 And so my mother went to...
 To open the door.
 And they were two Gestapos.
 And asking for my father.
 Oh, my God.
 Well, you can imagine.
 She was...
 Terrible.
 She was terrible.
 And they took my father in Prague.
 There was a huge palace.
 It's called Pechka's Palace.
 Mm-hmm.
 And they took him there.
 But fortunately for my father...
 Unfortunately for someone else, they discovered it was...
 There was a mistake of names.
 Oh.
 So they let him go.
 But the other...
 I don't know what happened to the other person.
 But it just shows you the situation in the country.
 And you remember that happening?
 You remember somebody coming and taking your father away in the morning?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I remember this very well.
 Oh, that's terrible.
 Terrible.
 Terrible.
 Yes.
 I remember this very well.
 And I remember that.
 I remember that.
 I remember that.
 I remember that.
 I remember that.
 I remember that.
 I remember that.
 I remember that.
 And that house that you lived in with your parents, is that something...
 Is that house still there?
 The house is still there.
 And was it belonging to your family all through...
 Did it stay in your family?
 Yes.
 But they were...
 You know, the house was...
 Because most of the part was empty, so it was just an open invitation for various soldiers
 and our armies.
 And they were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 They were...
 armies, including the Czech army, to live there for a while.
 So I remember that when was the Czech mobilization, that some of the Czech soldiers were actually
 living there.
 I remember my mother, she was making marmalade or whatever it was and was hiding it in one
 of the little rooms and that was before the soldiers came.
 And then she was saying that when the Czech army was dissolved, so she went back to the
 house and that was all gone.
 But the Germans occupied the village before
 the war.
 I remember one year they were planning to attack Yugoslavia.
 So they were gathering and mobilizing the German forces and one of them settled actually
 in that little village.
 So I remember the commander, he was living in a room which belonged to my uncle who was
 the mayor.
 So they thought that was the best.
 So I remember these soldiers, they were there.
 And I also remember that my grandfather who lived in the same house and he was already
 retired, but because he was quite old.
 You see before, when he was young, he went to school in České Budějovice or Bad Bajko.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 He was a very good soldier.
 But he still went to Yugoslavia and conquered Yugoslavia, but he said he was a communist.
 This is just a part of it.
 Did you feel, I mean you were sometimes living in Prague and sometimes living in the country.
 Did you experience Germans treating you badly, yourself?
 Myself? No.
 I mean around you, was everybody allowed to get on with their work?
 Oh yes.
 They didn't take away your cattle and take everything off the land?
 No, nothing of that kind.
 They let you carry on, it's just that they occupied you.
 They occupied you. Mind you, they needed the agriculture.
 The infrastructure to go on.
 To go on.
 And so this is one of the reasons why my uncle was...
 left alone because he was one of the largest farmers in the village.
 And they really needed the agriculture to feed the German army because they were very stiff.
 All others wanted to return.
 But otherwise there was no...
 Apart from the case when you were hiding some parachutist or...
 whatever.
 Otherwise all the people were sort of left alone.
 Yeah.
 So when Heydrich was killed, there wasn't a great big execution of people as a revenge.
 It was only that they clamped down on people.
 They didn't do a thing where they thought, you killed this man, we're going to kill this whole village.
 They didn't do anything like that?
 Well, they were...
 People had to be very careful not to speak.
 And if you kept quiet and didn't say anything,
 nothing happened.
 But there was a...
 Excuse me.
 There was a village north of Prague called Lidice.
 And in that village they somehow openly said they agreed with the execution of Hitler.
 Or something like that.
 And the Germans came and just leveraged the whole village off.
 It's still today they celebrate Lidice as a...
 They just shot everyone.
 They shot everyone.
 Children, women...
 Children, women and men.
 And they burned it or something.
 And they demolished everything.
 So today if you go there, it's sort of like a park.
 You see they planted trees.
 A memorial.
 A memorial.
 So Jaru, if you want to share your experience of the war, what is the most important thing
 that you've learned?
 Well, I think that the most important thing is that you have to be a good man.
 And that's the most important thing.
 And that's the most important thing.
 And that's the most important thing.
 And that's the most important thing.
 And that's the most important thing.
 And that's the most important thing.
 What is the most important thing you would like to share?
 It's very difficult.
 I mean, I knew a German woman who told me how she was in the Baker
 and the Baker asked her mother if she loved Hitler.
 And she really didn't love Hitler and she said, I love Christ.
 And the children all had to learn not to repeat anything that the parents said
 or that they were listening to the radio.
 I mean, did you feel the tension of a secret life?
 Well, of course.
 For instance, about the radio.
 Nobody was allowed to listen to the radio.
 The BBC.
 The BBC.
 And if you were, you were shot.
 And so because the Germans were so ruthless,
 so the word spreads, they may have shot not too many,
 but people speak and say, look, he said this.
 Myself, for instance, when my parents wanted me to go
 to the German army,
 I had to go to the German gymnasium.
 So it wasn't a simple case that you filled a form and asked.
 You had to go through a very vigorous exams,
 which took the whole week, every day, different subject.
 And one of the subjects was German.
 And I had to, I remember there was a committee of Germans,
 German women and...
 And so on.
 Whether they were teachers or I don't know who they were.
 But I was suddenly caught in front of them.
 And what I needed to, what I had to do,
 and I was told what I would be asked,
 it's the life story of somebody called Adolf Hitler.
 So I had to learn it by heart.
 Before, actually, that's what I did.
 You see, so I didn't say that he was good or anything,
 but he was born and such and such a day.
 And so...
 But otherwise, at school itself, in our school,
 there was nothing really which, apart from that,
 before every lecture in the morning,
 we would sort of say, I'm Hitler.
 But we didn't think much.
 You know, nobody believed it.
 Nobody...
 You knew that nobody believed it.
 It was just that you went through the motions,
 but you felt Czech.
 Yes, that's right.
 And you felt loyal to your own country.
 And you thought, these are invaders and we have to do this,
 but we don't love them.
 That's right.
 We don't believe in them.
 Yes, yes.
 But did anybody ever talk about that at home?
 Or did you ever hear your parents say that?
 Or was it just something that you all knew without speaking?
 Well, I knew and we spoke.
 And there was...
 People talk, you see, despite all this danger and so on.
 People talk, especially towards the end of the war.
 When the Germans were losing the war.
 So there were endless discussions.
 How long and who is where and where the Russians are
 and where the Americans are and where the British are.
 Because you were listening to the radio.
 Well, I don't know how...
 I don't know how it's actually filtered through.
 You didn't listen to the radio in your family?
 Well, we did, but what the Germans did,
 they, you see, in those days,
 each radio had medium waves, short waves and long waves.
 And the only way you...
 You could listen.
 Well, the short waves.
 If you wanted to listen to BBC.
 And there was a little coil.
 And everybody, the Germans took the trouble
 and visited every household, opened the radio and chipped.
 So you couldn't listen.
 They couldn't listen.
 And so...
 They got a nickname.
 You know, it's called Churchill lawyer.
 But people are clever.
 So somebody sort of replaced the boy.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 But we didn't...
 My father, I remember my father was listening
 to some station called Berominster.
 I remember Berominster.
 Which I think was from Switzerland.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 So you got information.
 And did you have enough food?
 Well, we had...
 Yes, we did, because of the farm.
 Right.
 I don't think...
 We were lucky from this point of view,
 because just outside our little house,
 there was a little field,
 and every year they planted potatoes.
 And I remember my grandfather,
 my grandmother would go there with a hoe
 and would dig up some of the potatoes.
 And so we would have...
 It was very simple.
 I mean, today, no worry.
 But I...
 You know, what my grandmother managed to do
 with simple potatoes,
 it's absolutely incredible.
 And it was still the same potatoes,
 but they were different every day.
 Ah.
 And I was...
 I was looking forward to it,
 because...
 And also meat, for instance,
 was unheard of,
 but they had chicken, for instance,
 or the ducks, or the geese, and then so...
 Fish?
 Fish?
 Fish.
 Yes, there was a fish,
 because the whole area,
 it's surrounded by fish.
 Oh, yes.
 And...
 But you couldn't go there and fish,
 because it would have been a game.
 You would have been shot.
 But the procedure with fishing,
 it's...
 It was a group of men,
 and they would drain the pond,
 and the poor fish was getting near,
 lower and lower,
 and in the end,
 they just...
 They did some instrument
 to...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 To...
 No, well we made cottage cheese.
 Yeah, something like that.
 And butter. I remember turning this, the little drum, and you sort of kept turning it.
 And they put the cream in there, and in the end what you get out was butter.
 And in addition was the, what is it called, milk?
 Buttermilk.
 Buttermilk. So I had no complaints of being hungry or anything, but it was thanks to the farm.
 And did you, when the war began, when they began to lose the war, how did the Germans behave?
 Did they look nervous? Did they look different? Did they...
 They looked, because they didn't know you, you see.
 They were brainwashed.
 They were brainwashed.
 Only those who were actually at the frontier, they would know.
 But the people living in the towns and in some, they didn't know.
 Because when you listened to the radio, everything was marvelous.
 Yeah.
 There was news from the Hitler's camp, and they were telling, we won this and we beat them there.
 Oh yes, yes. It wasn't true.
 Did you feel afraid of the Russians coming? Were you afraid of Russians or did you feel you would be liberated by them?
 That you were fellow, you were all oppressed and you would all help each other?
 Yes. We were actually, well, at that time everybody was supporting the Russians mentally and so on, because they were beating the Germans.
 Mm-hmm.
 .
 .
!
 And again, you didn't know exactly where they were.
 Mm-hmm.
 Unless, until towards the end of the war when the actual Russians came.
 No, nobody knew really for sure.
 So tell me what you were doing when you heard that Hitler had invaded Czechoslovakia.
 Can you remember how you heard about that? What were you doing? How did you know?
 Well, that was all open on the radio station. And it was, that was just stated as a matter of fact that the German, the Germans, what they call, maybe liberated, liberated the country.
 Oh, disgusting. And so tell me how you knew that they had lost.
 Well, we knew that because suddenly there were these, that, that, we knew that only during the past three days.
 So in what month was it?
 It was in May.
 In 1945.
 1945.
 Right.
 It was in May, in May 1945. And suddenly the news came that the war was nearly finished.
 Right.
 But still you didn't know because the Germans were still there in Prague. And, but they were not fighting. They were actually running away. But when it got to the face of May.
 You saw them deserting. They were leaving. They were, they'd lost discipline and just started to run away. There was nobody leading them anymore.
 Well, they were still, you know, they still had the discipline. And they were, the aim of theirs was to run to the west and give themselves up to the Americans.
 Oh, right. They were scared of the Russians because of what they had done.
 But not, not, you know, they were scared of the Russians. And, and so when, during this sort of confusing,
 Mm-hmm.
 period, the Prague town was very, very sort of muddled up and confused because somebody was telling about the Americans are already here.
 So everybody was celebrating and everybody was glad. Suddenly there was no sign of the Americans.
 Oh, rumors. It was rumors.
 It was rumors.
 Mm-hmm.
 And, and suddenly.
 Mm-hmm.
 And, and, and, overnight the Russians came. You see, because we, we, because the Germans started bombing part of, of Prague towards the end.
 Mm-hmm.
 And so my parents and I, we decided to, to go away. And we were told because that part of Prague was, we were told would be bombed.
 Oh, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 So I remember how myself and my mother and my father decided to, to go, go away. And we were aiming to go again to west, to the west to, to give ourselves up to, because there was no, no, no news about the Russians or nothing at all.
 Mm-hmm.
 So we set off from, from our flat.
 Mm-hmm.
 up to because there was no news about the Russians or nothing at all. So we set off
 from our flat and overnight, and it took the whole night. To walk? To walk. And we
 walked from our town and followed the river at that time, the river of Bratava, it was very large.
 And so the nearest, we had to go to the nearest bridge, and the nearest bridge happened to be in the middle of Prague.
 So that's what we did. We just walked and walked, and I remember hearing the shrapnel shooting overnight.
 You mean the airplanes dropping bombs or the soldiers fighting? Cannons.
 Oh yes.
 And eventually we arrived in Prague.
 We reached this bridge, and there was a barricade because everybody, including us, to begin with, you see, we were building barricades to stop the Germans going anywhere.
 And so we got to this bridge, and there was a man, and he said, I just saw an American patrol here a few minutes ago.
 And so everything is finished. So we were so, so, you know, so pleased.
 So we quickly crossed the bridge, and we were so tired, and on the other side of the bridge, there was a spa for swimming, you see.
 I still don't believe what I saw at that time.
 You see, there we were, people getting...
 Battered and killed and so on.
 There were people swimming in their white costumes and so on.
 And so, because we were so tired, so we said just, there was a waiting room for the swimmers and so on.
 So my parents sat down, and I went out, and across the road was a church.
 And I was consecrated to St. Wenceslaus.
 So I was just wandering, and suddenly a lorry came.
 And on that lorry were people wrapped up, dead bodies wrapped up in the white sort of clothes or something like that.
 And I remember that people were unloading these bodies, taking them into the church, and were sort of lining them up in front of the altar.
 To be buried, or...?
 Well, eventually.
 But they didn't know what to do with them, and it was still fighting.
 So they thought, obviously, that the church would be a safe place for...
 So that's what happened. I remember this.
 How...
 How the dead bodies were being lined up.
 You couldn't see the bodies because they were wrapped?
 They were wrapped.
 But were they soldiers, or...?
 No, they were local citizens.
 They were the people who died in the battles.
 In the battles.
 And so, obviously, there was a fighting not very far from where we were.
 So we decided to push on to the west.
 And we did go.
 And we went and went.
 And through Prague and towards the western frontier.
 And I remember there was some stranger, some man who joined us.
 And so there were four of us.
 And so we went, and we went.
 And then eventually we came to a village.
 And there was a...
 You know, there was a...
 There was a...
 A little church with a cemetery.
 And so I don't know we went...
 Why we went exactly to this.
 But I remember there was already a grave opened.
 And there were dead...
 Dead people.
 Was that a mass grave?
 No, it was only two of them.
 Or maybe three.
 But these, these were actually who joined the Czech fighters fighting the Germans.
 The partisans.
 The Russian, Vlasov, Russian soldiers.
 And they were, during the war, they were fighting on the German side.
 Oh, I see.
 And they cost them dearly later on.
 So had they been executed because they had been...
 They had gone over to the wrong side?
 Yes.
 Aha.
 But not...
 When we were still there, they were shot obviously by the Germans.
 So the Germans shot the Russians who were helping them?
 Yes.
 Because towards the end...
 Because they were frightened that they would change sides?
 Because they suddenly, they changed...
 You know, the Russians, they changed sides.
 They started shooting the Germans.
 Yes, yes.
 Had they been forced to become prisoners?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.

 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 with each other. Georgia? Georgians?
 No, no, no, more to the south, but Armenians.
 Czech, Ukrainians? Ukrainians.
 Oh, yes, yes. I think they were Ukrainians.
 Anyway, so I was looking into the grave,
 and they were just dumped there,
 and they did these, what he thought, Russian soldiers,
 and they were just dumped there into these,
 and there were quite a few of them.
 By this time, it was already dark,
 so I remember we were taken. There was a school,
 and we were taken to this school for the night,
 my mother and my father and myself.
 I said, perhaps you may wondering where is my sister?
 Well, my sister was very seriously ill
 at the beginning of the year, 1945,
 and she was really mortally ill.
 What did she have to matter?
 She had her liver.
 She somehow, the liver were attacked by something,
 and she was...
 Well, I still have some photographs.
 She looked really so bad, and everybody thought she would die.
 Oh, yes.
 And my mother, including Agnes, they thought that the reason ...
 She didn't know she wasn't there at that time, of course,
 but it was one of the severe winters,
 and my mother then thought that it ...
 they somehow, the coldness attacked my liver and her.
 I'll never forget that night.
 You see, we were together in the same room,
 and she was just suddenly shaking.
 I've never experienced it again.
 It was frightening.
 And so my uncle, who was, as I said,
 he was the mayor of the village,
 he somehow organized she would be transferred
 to a little town called Indriku Hradec.
 That was the hospital.
 Oh, yes.
 And so she spent basically the rest of the war there,
 and she was even, then she was lucky,
 because some, in April, I don't know,
 I don't remember,
 which month it was,
 they suddenly heard an airplane above,
 and there was an alarm,
 and they thought the town would be bombed.
 Well, it was not the case.
 But because of this,
 they shifted all the patients into the cellar,
 and there was no...
 So she was saved.
 Let me see if I know what to do now.
 Oh, sorry, Jero.
 So I'm...
 I'm going to stop?
 Yeah.
 There we go.
 So your sister, how,
 when did she recover from her illness?
 Was it long after the war, or...?
 Well, she just,
 it was just,
 at that time, the war was coming to an end.
 So she,
 she was in that hospital in Indriku Hradec,
 and
 now,
 my parents had to sort of divide,
 because towards the end of the war,
 my mother was with me,
 my father was with me,
 and I was there,
 so there were the three of us.
 But my sister,
 she was being looked after,
 my grandmother,
 in that farmhouse.
 And so,
 then I heard what actually happened,
 how the German armies,
 were rushing through the village towards,
 towards the west.
 Mm-hmm.
 And, and so,
 she must have been released from the hospital
 just about at the same time,
 towards the beginning of May.
 And after this, she's remarkable.
 She was, she was
 as fit as, as ever.
 Mm-hmm.
 But when I saw him for the first time,
 when,

 The next morning I remember we woke up and we got up and we were actually occupied by the Russians.
 And so we were told that the war was finished and that we should go home.
 And that moment there was somebody with a small lorry and so we hopped on that lorry and he took us down to Prague.
 And that was the end of the war.
 But Jero, when you arrived in Prague and you went to your house, was the door locked and everything safe?
 Or...
 Everything was...
 Nobody had broken into your house?
 Nobody had broken in, nothing at all.
 How amazing.
 Amazing.
 And there was... could you use a telephone?
 We never had a telephone.
 Was there a public telephone? You couldn't ring and find out how your sister was or...
 No.
 You had to go and see them.
 Because where she was there was no telephone.
 Oh yes, yes.
 And we didn't have any telephone.
 Okay.
 So we spent some short time in Prague.
 Prague?
 Yes.
 And just as soon as it was possible, because there were no trains, as soon as it was possible
 we just hopped on the train and we went south towards here.
 And there were stories, you see, filtering people to be careful with Russians because they were raping women.
 But even in occupied countries?
 Even in occupied countries.
 I thought they raped Germans.
 No, even the Russians, they didn't know where they were.
 You see, it was very...
 Anyway, so I remember going there not the normal way, which was...
 We went across the fields and eventually we got there and...
 So it was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 It was a very...
 So it was all right. But the Russians, they were really, they were on the command of General
 Rokossovsky. And you had to be very careful. They were shooting, they were living off the
 land. You see, in that part of the world, there were a lot of deer and hares and so on.
 And once, it was an unfortunate accident, one of the Russian soldiers was aiming and
 shooting a deer. And as it happened, on the same line behind us, there was a boy and a
 family making hay, because it was just, and he was killed. He was shot and killed.
 So...
 You remember that?
 I remember that.
 Did you know the boy?
 I don't think because he was from the neighboring village. Maybe I knew him, but...
 But there was a kind of catastrophe around war. War is a catastrophe.
 Oh yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 But we're talking about catastrophes. There was another incident which was, which actually
 involved Americans.
 Oh, yes.
 And they were shooting.


 Towards the end of the war, the Americans adopted a sort of tactic to destroy all the trains,
 so that, you know, to paralyze the German soldiers.
 And where I come from, in the South Bohemia, there is a sort of a hub.
 This is where my father started his working.
 Anyway, at one spot, not very far from the railway station, there was the signal halt.
 And I was there.
 For the train, so the train stopped.
 And suddenly an aircraft, a small American aircraft came and was shooting at the locomotive.
 And that was very common towards the end of the war.
 This is how they just thought they would weaken the Germans.
 Unfortunately, the same line of that airplane,

















 airplane. There was one man who comes from the same village I go to, and he was, when
 he heard this coming, so he was hiding himself behind some compost heap.
 Unfortunately, he was on the same line as the American was shooting, and he shot him
 dead. But he was quite old, and it's one of those things that you said that was, it
 was not a pity that it happened to, during the very last few days of the war.
 Terrible, terrible. And at that point you were not afraid of the Russians, you saw them
 as liberators.
 Yes, although, as I've said, when we were actually returning from Prague to see my sister,

 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians. I was afraid of the Russians.
 a time where every day people looked in the newspaper to see the names of who
 had died and the soldiers were all away. My grandfather said goodbye to my
 grandmother and said I'll see you at Christmas and came back at the end after
 being captured at Arnhem. In Czechoslovakia there were no Czechs
 fighting. They were just oppressed. They were made to keep
 running the country but they were never allowed to fight.
 But were there partisans? There were partisans in the forest because the
 country you see about 75% of the area was just woodland.
 So there were partisans but

 in that part of the world I used to live. There was actually nothing.
 Because there was nothing important. You see there was no industry.
 There was nothing. You were allowed to be a bit in peace really in a way.
 Yes we were allowed to live in peace and provided that people sort of kept quiet.
 Obeyed and shut up. And I'm sorry to ask you but
 did you know any people who were Jewish in your life? Did you know people at school?
 Not at school. At school that was never actually divided between you know we
 were just but there were no Jews there. But I remember seeing Jews in
 Prague streets sweeping the floor and sweeping the streets.
 Did they have to have stars? Yes. They would have this Judea here. The star.
 And these were the lucky ones because they could go home or I don't know what.
 But they were allowed to be in the street.
 Whereas many others they were in concentration camps and so on.
 They were very much worse off.
 Did you, when did you come to Prague?
 I came to Prague in the summer of the 19th century.
 Did you ever see people going in trains?
 Yes.
 And did you know what was going to happen to them?
 No.
 Nobody knew. They were going to camps but you didn't know what happened in those camps?
 We didn't know what. I remember these trains just passing through the railway station just
 not very far from.
 Cattle trucks.
 Cattle trucks.
 And you knew they were full of people. Could you see the people?
 Yes because they were looking out. You could see them.
 Yes.
 They were looking out. You couldn't help them.
 Were there bars? And what did it make you feel?
 Well, that was really terrible because we weren't quite sure what was going to happen.
 You see, whether they would be killed. Obviously now today we know they were probably taken to Auschwitz.
 Yes.
 Or Auschwitz.
 Auschwitz or the obvious place. There was not very far from us in Austria was one concentration
 camp called Mauthausen.
 Is that the one with the very big quarry?
 Yes.
 It was a terrible place.
 Yes.
 Awful, awful place.
 Yes.
 Was that in Czechoslovakia, that camp?
 No, but it was just on the frontier.
 Oh, right.
 But of course during the war there was no frontier so it was all one country.
 But they... I remember Mauthausen and then I remember Buchenwald and...
 Is Buchenwald outside Weimar?
 Yes.
 Agnes had to walk around Buchenwald, didn't she?
 Yes, she had.
 She was made to do that?
 Yes.
 Was she a student?
 She was only twelve then.
 She couldn't have been a student.
 Well, she was a grown-up student.
 So after the war somebody like Agnes was a student.
 So how old were you at the end of the war?
 At the end of the war, it was 1945, I was thirteen.
 And Agnes must have been younger.
 She was twelve.
 So she must have been a school student when she was made to do that.
 She was a school student.
 A school student.
 Yes.
 And she was a student of the German army.
 Yes.
 And she was a student of the German army.
 Yes.
 And she was a student of the German army.
 Yes.
 And she was a student of the German army.
 Yes.
 And she was a student of the German army.
 Yes.
 And she was a student of the German army.
 She was twelve.
 So she must have been a school student when she was made to go look at a concentration
 camp. That's a bit... Especially as she was Czech and it wasn't her. I mean, I thought
 it was the Germans who were made to go look at the camps. Because if you're occupied,
 you can't really do anything about what happens, can you?
 No, you can't do anything.
 So do you remember the first time you heard what had actually happened to the Jews?
 I heard it... That was after the war. When the war was, you know, over. Suddenly it all,
 you know, became...
 Everything came out. But do you remember the first time you heard about that and what that
 made you feel? What were you doing?
 Well, that was really terrible.
 Yeah.
 I remember I heard how the... For instance, there was one town, small town, which is in
 the Czech Republic today. And it's called Terezin.
 Oh, yes, Terezin.
 Or Terezin Stad.
 Mm-hmm.
 And so there were some really very prominent persons imprisoned.
 Yes.
 One of them, somebody called Karl Ancel, who was the leading conductor.
 Yes.
 Very, very prominent. And he was... But it was very strange because the Germans were
 pretending or trying to convince the outside world that this Terezin was very good.
 Yes.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 And they were very, very good.
 But that was just a small area, not very far, a few hundred yards away, they were shooting the
 the dead.
 And that was the place where everybody was shipped and then shipped off to Auschwitz?
 But also even in Terezin there were some murdering people.
 Yes. Did they work? Did they have to work?
 Well, it was very strange, the whole town, and it was, as I've said, it was just a show for the outside world.
 That Terezin itself was sort of presented to the outside world as a normal town.
 There were schools and even today they show

















































 pictures by the children. And they had their own orchestra and playing music and that kind of thing.
 But there was a gate which is still there today and if you went through the gate you never came back.
 So how did you find out about that? Did you hear it on the news or did you go to see it at the cinema?
 Well you didn't hear about this during the war at all.
 No, no, but at the end?
 At the end suddenly, well it was on the news and the newspapers and then suddenly it all became sort of public.
 But I mean this Terezín was exceptional.
 Although some, Roberta's or Agnes's
 cousin or uncle or something like that, he was actually murdered there.
 That was the last day of the war. It was very unfortunate. He was Czech.
 But he was in Terezínstadt even though he wasn't Jewish?
 It wasn't only that.
 It was everybody who they didn't like basically.
 And Jarro, when you heard about that,
 what did it do to your soul?
 Well that was the situation. Everybody was so glad that the war was over.
 That people didn't really, I don't know, but I remember one case with a Jew
 in the south Bohemia before the war. He had,
 he was an industrialist or something. He had a factory making gloves.
 And he sort of suddenly appeared and to this day I don't really know whether he was in concentration
 camp or not because he was, well he just, he was a rich man and he was making the gloves again.
 Oh he came back?
 Yeah he came back.
 Oh my goodness.
 He came back and then he, I remember even, and he had a car which in those days was very something,
 very exceptional. And I remember giving, and he didn't know the rules and he didn't know anything.
 And once he was giving me a lift and that was a touch and go that we didn't,
 we didn't have an accident.
 He didn't know how to drive the car really?
 No he didn't.
 So he survived and came back and opened his factory again. And was he welcomed?
 People didn't hate the Jews or, that you saw?
 No people didn't. I didn't, didn't hear anything, anything just up against him.
 Any action by the...
 You don't remember being taught that the Jews had killed Christ or?
 No.
 As a child?
 No.
 Your, your Catholic priest didn't speak like that?
 No.
 Because that's what some people did wasn't it?
 Yes. No that was, there was no...
 So you didn't ever experience in yourself that you had been brought up to mistrust Jews or?
 No.
 Oh that's good isn't it?
 No.
 And the Jews,
 and the Jews,
 for instance in that village,
 or that little town which is nearby to the village,
 they had all sorts of business, little businesses,
 like selling clothes or,
 I remember one was called Kirschner, you know with a name like that you can't be a,
 you can't be a Czech because, and they were sort of accepted and everything.
 Yeah.
 And they were all very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
 against. Yeah, so maybe they had a bad time then as well. But there again you see the first
 communist government, the leaders they were all Jews. You know when communists took over
 in Czechoslovakia, so the leaders, most of them, they were Jews. Jewish communists.
 Jewish communists. Yeah. So Jaro, the war has over, you're 12 years old, your sister's getting better.
 Did you go back and live in Prague? Yes, I went back to Prague and I returned because at that time
 it's, you know, the war found me halfway through the gymnasium studies.
 So I went back to the same school, so to speak,
 and I remember the professor of mathematics and
 his name was Kráty. He was, and I'm thankful to him for what I, because he was a very good
 scholar and teacher. And so, but this kind of situation lasted
 only about until 1948. So how many years? Two or three years. And suddenly the communists organized
 what they call a coup. And they... Sorry, what year was that? That was 1948. So you had three years without communism?






 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.

 I had three years without communism.
 I had three years without communism.

 there was communism, and it was situation ...
 15.
 15. You were 15.
 Yeah, two, three.
 And it was a situation like you get here.
 It's not all you have here.
 Everybody is a priest, and everybody was talking to everybody,
 and everything was normal, but these communists forever,
 because they wanted to get the country, which they did.
 With the help of the Russians.
 With the help of the Russians.
 So the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia were Czech.
 They were Czech.
 They weren't Russian invaders.
 No, no. They were Czech.
 Oh, yes.
 And they even ... It was 1946.
 I remember the elections, and these communists came first.
 You see, so they ...
 So they were watching power.
 Yes, and they were really very aggressive and very pushing.
 Yeah.
 And so ...
 There were militants.
 There were four parties, communists and social democrats.
 Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Parties, communists and social democrats, and then there was what they called themselves
 socialists and there was another party, I can't remember.
 And there was another election, it was 1948, and during this election there was a sort
 of stalemate and the communists, and the communists again were the leading party, but
 the others were trying to form a coalition.
 And the communists just organized some kind of uprising or something like that.
 Or they call it coup.
 And the others, it's quite amazing, they just gave up without any fight and then so on.
 Most of the leaders, they ran away to the west.
 And the communists were in power.
 And I remember how people were saying, were laughing.

 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 They were laughing.
 you see they were saying that they won't last a fortnight because they didn't have the support.
 When you actually compare the communists with the rest of the country, well the rest of the country
 was really much stronger. 60 years they lasted. 60 years they lasted.
 That was a big mistake wasn't it to think they wouldn't last?
 I remember this my uncle he said he was laughing and he said look at them they won't last a minute.
 60 years. Let's hope that UKIP doesn't turn out to be powerful the way everybody laughs at UKIP
 as well don't they? Yes. Funny you said this because I am getting the same ideas. I feel
 I feel so scared when I hear people being so light-hearted about it.
 Because I somehow feel like living in a second life.
 Yes, I understand.
 So Jaro, can I just get a picture of you?
 All these things were going on in the country, these world events, but you were a young boy
 of 15, and when you were 12, the war had ended and you were at the gymnasium.
 I mean, did you have friends?
 Were you political?
 Did you have hobbies?
 Well, the school, that was after the communists took over.
 The communists started to organize themselves, you see.
 And so in our school, there I was.

 They were trying to organize something which they called a national movement or something
 like that.
 And I still, to this day, I still remember that they organized a meeting in the drawing
 room, where we, you know, that was the largest room in the school.
 The art room.
 Art room.
 Yeah.
 And I remember that everybody, except one, was there.

 Everybody was against the communists.
 But this one was a communist.
 And so he obviously went to the communist headquarters or something like that.
 And he won.
 So whatever the communists wanted, that was done.
 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.



 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.

 And that was the way it was.
 And that was the way it was.

 And that was the way it was.
 That was the first year and then it sort of started one after the other.
 So Jaro, can I just check? During the war you all had to learn to speak German, but you were also allowed to speak Czech.
 We were allowed to speak Czech.
 But you had to have your education in German?
 We had to have... German was one of the, if not the important language.
 And German was... I spoke fluent German at that time.
 Because of the war?
 Because of the war.
 Because you had been taught... but you were allowed to speak your language to each other in the shops and at school.
 But you had to be able to understand and speak German as part of...
 Yes.
 ...being allowed to survive.
 That's right.
 And when the German soldiers spoke to you, they always spoke in German, so...
 They always spoke to German.
 And I... as I said, I just remember when I was sitting the exams for the gymnasium, how that committee was there.
 And they were just...
 All German?
 They were just German. They were all Germans.
 And I passed.
 So...
 So...
 I knew Hitler's...
 Life story?
 Life story by heart.
 And so I just told them this and they seemed happy.
 But when... so when the country became communist, did you all have to learn to speak Russian?
 Yes.
 That part of the education was Russian.
 But you were quite old by then. Did you still have to learn Russian?
 Oh, yes.
 Gosh, I don't understand how you all coped.
 Well, that was 1940, 48, when suddenly this Russian language came.
 And we had to learn... well, we had to learn and we hated it because if you are forced something, you don't like it.
 No.
 And so that... you know, that was the case.
 And then we...
 You had also... I mean, your biography is one which is caught up in the middle of the worst catastrophes of the century, isn't it, really?
 Yes.
 I mean, the... how people coped is really incredible.
 So... so can you read Tolstoy?
 Uh...
 I mean, is your Russian good enough that you could read a novel or...?
 But... no.
 I... you see, nobody liked Russian.
 And... so when suddenly Stalin died, this was the breakpoint.
 How... when... what year did he die?
 It was nineteen...
 53, I think.
 Oh, long time.
 Yes.
 So I spoke, I remember we had lessons in Russian, for instance, at school and so on.
 And that was all in Russian and I was really fluent.
 And of course Russian is not very far from the Czech.
 No.
 You know, there are many words and...
 But because we didn't like it, it was like with the Germans, you see.
 So you try to forget it as quickly as possible.
 Oh, I see.
 When Stalin died, do you remember how that was received in the country?
 Well, it's...
 There was no celebration, so nothing at all.
 But I remember on the radio, you see, they suddenly...
 normal broadcasting stopped.
 And they announced that, you know, Comrade Stalin was taken ill.
 They didn't say that, I don't know how critical it was.
 And...
 And they started playing solemn music, Beethoven and...
 And that was the only time you could listen to a serious good music during this.
 And of course then he died.
 There was a state funeral.
 There was a state funeral and...
 And at that state funeral were invited all the strong communist leaders, including the
 Czech president, Godwald.
 So he went to the funeral.
 And it was a bitter cold winter.
 And somehow he must have been infected or cold in this.
 Because...
 And he was there for a month or not even a month.
 Shortly after the Stalin's funeral, Godwald died.
 Well...
 And so he was buried and...
 And somebody else, another communist, Zapotutski was his name.
 He...
 He...
 He became president.
 So...
 But it was quite noticeable about coming back to Stalin.
 How soon the...
 Everything changed.
 How one person, how we can change the whole world nearly.
 Because, you know, part of the...
 Although I was studying civil engineering, nothing to do with politics.
 But we would have once or twice a week in the afternoon to most terrible hours discussing
 the pronouncements of Comrade Stalin.
 That was something most terrible.
 Because it was...
 It was in...
 Towards the end of the day, you were tired studying and so on.
 And so we were sort of falling asleep.
 We did.
 And that chap who was in charge and who was...
 He was saying, wake up, wake up.
 This is not the sitting of a young...
 Toddlers, toddlers.
 This is...
 But anyway, the same man, he was...
 He was saying Stalin, Comrade Stalin was this and this.
 The best, best man in the world.
 But when he died, suddenly I remember the first time.
 Suddenly I remember the first lesson we had with him.
 The same man?
 The same man suddenly said, you know, Comrade Stalin was making mistakes.
 He didn't say he was this, but he was sometimes making mistakes.
 And then it all started and Khrushchev came and so on.
 So it just shows you...
 It showed me that everything was based on lies.
 And of course then...
 Everything's changed a lot.
 And...
 I just...
 But the president, the Czech president, he was still sort of good communist.
 So although he agreed that Stalin wasn't all that...
 But we were still allowed to sort of...
 To live.
 And then somebody called Beria came.
 And Beria was one of the fiercest communists during Stalin's regime.
 Russian?
 Russian.
 Isn't he the person who was in charge of the secret police?
 Yes.
 He was famously evil and dark and terrifying.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And he came to Czechoslovakia?
 No, no, no, no, but...
 He came into power?
 He came to power.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 And the radio and...
 That was just our country.
 You know, I mean, our president, when Stalin was still alive, he was forced...
 Maybe it was his doing.
 But at least once a month, he would board his plane and flew to Moscow for instructions and discussion.
 How to behave.
 How to behave.
 So he couldn't do, even if he liked, he couldn't do what, you know, what he liked.
 So, Jarosz, when you were living under communist rule, did you have to join the National Service?
 Well, yes, yes, I had to, but it was a sort of funny National Service, because they needed engineers.
 Oh, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 And so they...
 They didn't make you be a soldier?
 Well, I was a soldier, but I was a soldier and I was a student at the same time.
 I'm coming.
 It's Tom.
 Oh, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 She...
 He...
 Where was I?

 And it was not only sort of doing left and right, but doing really how to shoot and the
 trajectory of cannonballs and things like that.
 But once a year in the summer I would have to, I was obliged to go on a, in a camp, on
 the proper army, you know, and of course the sergeant majors, you know, the existing, they
 knew about us and they hated us.
 And so they really gave us a proper deal.
 They hated you because you were Czech?
 Not Czech, but because we didn't…
 You were engineers.
 We were engineers.
 And so they…
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I couldn't, most time I spent cleaning my shoes.
 Oh dear.
 I couldn't go to the toilet.
 I couldn't, there was no time for anything.
 I have since then, I have never experienced that kind of regime in my life.
 So it was really bullying.
 Bullying.
 Trying to break you.
 Yes.
 And how long did that go on?
 That wasn't just during the war.
 It was during the war.
 During the summer holidays.
 Like six weeks or something?
 Something like that.
 Oh dear.
 Quite a long time.
 Quite a long time.
 And they hated you because you weren't ordinary soldiers.
 You were educated.
 They tried.
 Because all the other ordinary soldiers were there for two years.
 Oh, I see.
 And we just came for…
 Oh, so they thought you were having special treatment and they would really give you a
 hard time.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And so I remember the first, first day we got the task to watch the war.
 And you were in the army?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And you were in the army?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 if you wet it with that cloth and run with it like a herd from one corner to the other.
 It looked clean.
 It looked clean and you said, you see, you can do it!
 And did you have good friends? Did you all help each other?
 Oh yes, but we were from the same class.
 So you were comrades and you joked and helped each other?
 Oh yes, we just joked.
 And the other soldiers, were they horrible to you?
 Well they were somewhere else, you see, they never mixed that together.
 So how many years did that go on, that you had to do that?
 Five years.
 Oh my goodness me, how absolutely awful!
 And I had to sit exams, like for mathematics and for civil engineering.
 The same kind of exams for the army, you know, because they shoot like...
 Oh yes, to learn how to do those things.
 So, so, no, I...
 So how old were you when you stopped doing national service? Twenty-one?
 Well, I... then it sort of continued. I was caught regularly even when I was married.
 You have to go every year, like in Switzerland?
 Yes.
 Just for six weeks in the summer or...?
 Something like that, yes.
 Quite a long time.
 Yes.
 And did that bullying continue?
 No, when we grew up, so they didn't dare, you see, so much.
 Oh I see.
 It was only when you were boys.
 Yes.
 But to begin with, they, you know, they gave us...
 I couldn't even wipe my nose.
 And I have never experienced anybody treating me like that.
 Yeah.
 So they... the whole point about the army is to break you, so that they can build you up in their own image.
 That's right.
 And that's the process that you were going through.
 That's right.
 It's an absolute affront...
 Yes.
 ...to the human dignity of a...
 That's right.
 ...awful, awful...
 That's right.
 ...break you of the spirit.
 But Jaro, how old were you when you finished school then?
 I finished school in 1956, so I was 24.
 And, gosh, does school go on so long?
 Well, it was then the university...
 Oh, you mean you finished university at 24?
 Yes.
 And you complete...
 When you finished school, ordinary school, and you were stopping at boy and you went
 to university, did you go and live away from home?
 Well, then shortly after this, we...
 I got married to Agnes.
 But when you were a student at university...
 I lived with my parents.
 You lived with your parents.
 And then...
 So can you just tell me about meeting Agnes?
 Well...
 I still remember it very well.
 Very well.
 In detail.
 How old were you?
 I was...
 That was four years before...
 I must have been about 20.
 Twenty, right.
 And she was 18.
 And she...
 She went to school with my sister, to the same classroom.
 Same age.
 The same age.
 And so I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that...
 I remember that suddenly, I don't know who organized this, but I found myself in a cinema.
 My sister was there, her boyfriend, and I was there.
 And I remember that we were visiting, that the film was about, you know, the Polish-French pianist Chopin.
 Oh yes!
 The life of Chopin.
 Oh right.
 And I can't remember anything of this film, but I remember the Chopin.
 Yes, yes.
 And so she was sitting beside me.
 Were you set up? Did your sister try and set you both up?
 Was it what is called in America a blind date?
 Or did you know you were going to be introduced to Agnes?
 Yes, I knew I was going to be introduced to Agnes, but that was just nothing.
 You didn't think that they... you were just a group of friends going out.
 We were just friends.
 You were...
 From school.
 Oh, it wasn't bad.
 We were right.
 Because she went to the same class as I did.
 So anyway, so we went there and I had a look at it and had a film.
 Yes, and then we went home.
 And at that time I didn't think much of it or anything.
 I went home and she went home.
 I even went with her to her house and in front of the house I bowed and said goodbye
 and I thought that was it, you see.
 But she had different ideas, obviously.
 Because the next week I got an invitation to...
 that there was some very important exhibition near the Prague Castle, you know.
 Mm-hmm.
 And I was told.
 And whether I would like to join her.
 This actually came through my sister, this invitation.
 So I said, well...
 Were you interested in art?
 Not a lot.
 Most engineers aren't.
 No, that's right.
 So...
 So I went.
 You don't remember what the artist was to you?
 It was a mixture.
 Oh, it was a general thing.
 General thing.
 And...
 But what I...
 Where I became suspicious, there was suddenly no sister of mine and no my brother.
 It was just Agnes and I.
 And so we went.
 We went through the procedure.
 Mm-hmm.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 And we went through the procedure.
 No, no, no.
 You were just obliviously thinking you were just being invited to exhibitions and things.
 You weren't quite aware of the plan.
 No, I was very stupid.
 Or not stupid.
 Naive.
 Naive.
 Yes, yes.
 And then I got…
 I never organized everything when I actually think of it now.
 It was always Agnes.
 Who initiated things.
 She initiated.
 And then suddenly I was invited to some concert of folk dances and folk music, which again
 wasn't my…
 But anyway, so I said, okay, I'll go.
 So I did go and it was good.
 And then she said she was going to show.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 And then I said, okay, I'll go.
 And then she said, okay, I'll go.
 No, not at all.
 It was butchery.
 So this is how it all started.
 You see, because then when I went to the butcher, I somehow took a fancy of her.
 You fell in love?
 Well, you may call it that, yes, I fell in love.
 You felt interested.
 Your eye was caught.
 My eye was caught, yes.
 Because Agnes was very, very pretty.
 She was.
 When I look at those photographs, she was so beautiful.
 My father used to say that.
 Yes, she was.
 In Woola he said, Agnes is so beautiful.
 Anyway, so that's how it all started.
 And so I went to this butcher and then I took her home again.
 And...
 And then it...
 That's how it all started, you see.
 Then we...
 Then we agreed that we would meet again.
 And...
 And so on.
 And then...
 This was, I remember the date.
 It was 17th of January, 1951, I think.
 This was the day of the butcher?
 Or the day of the cinema?
 It was the day of the cinema.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 Not of the butcher.
 And so after this, and then I remember I inviting her.
 I thought my mother should know about this.
 So I told my mother and I invited Agnes.
 It was Easter.
 And we had some better meal.
 So I invited Agnes and she came.
 And I think she made a good impression.
 My father was there as well.
 She was at that time a student studying history of art?
 No.
 She was still at school?
 She was still at school.
 Oh, wow.
 She was at the gymnasium.
 I see.
 Well, we were so close.
 We were so close.
 We were so close.
 We were so close.
 We were so close.
 We were sort of courting each other four years before we got married.
 Right.
 And so, but it was quite near the end of her, of her gymnasium studies.
 And so…
 Do you remember meeting Aunt Robin?
 So she was taken to meet your parents and they liked her.
 And then were you taken to meet hers?
 Yes.
 Yes, I remember meeting her, but it was a different occasion.
 It was at a dance.
 We, you know, in Prague, springtime, it's everybody now dances all over.
 And so my sister went and her friend.
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 And so…
 Agnes's mother. And I remember the mother, she was absolutely astonished that Agnes could actually dance.
 Oh really? Is it...
 About two minutes.
 Okay, thank you. We won't be long.
 Two minutes, yeah.
 Two minutes what?
 For lunch.
 You have to sit beautifully with your napkin at one o'clock.
 Is it only? Sorry, what do I call it?
 Yes, it is. Agnes and the dancing. You invited Agnes to a dance and that was the first time you met Aunt Robin because Aunt Robin was the chaperone.
 Yes.
 And you said that Aunt Robin was very surprised that...
 Agnes was able to dance.
 But I suppose she must have learnt at school.
 We all would have learnt at school.
 Not in Czech school. You wouldn't learn dancing in the Czech school.
 Oh, I see.
 But you could... there were so many institutions and clubs and so on where you would learn dancing.
 And you could dance?
 I could dance.
 So you'd learnt it at a... at an institution?
 Yes.
 And that dancing meant waltzing or folk dancing or...
 Foxtrot, waltz, polka, tango.
 Oh, really?
 I learnt actually this in the South Bohemia, in Drahov.
 There were two girls and they taught me.
 They taught me to dance.
 So I was well prepared.
 That was lucky, I wrote.
 I was lucky.
 So, no, I danced okay.
 So you had introduced Agnes to your parents.
 You now met Agnes' mother, but not her father.
 Not her father.
 And you were thinking of yourself as sweethearts by then.
 You were... you weren't engaged or anything like that?
 No.
 You were just going out.
 You were courting.
 That's right.
 That's the world.
 Well, we were going out and we were going to cinemas and we were going for a walk or
 we usually once a week on Sunday afternoon.
 And in the middle of your courting, did Agnes finish school and start university?
 Yes.
 And she was studying the history of art?
 And she was studying history of art.
 And was it the same university as you?
 No.
 Well, I went to a technical university whereas she went to the proper university.
 Yes, I understand.
 So, but did you get the equivalent of the Abitur?
 Did you...
 You know, in Germany you have these two different examples.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 with the experts and political persons and so on about the result.
 And so I did.
 And all the mathematics and so on, I did alright and I didn't have any problems.
 And then came this so-called social discussion and that woman who was in the committee, she
 said, you don't talk very much, do you?
 And so I didn't know what to say and she said, if you keep like that you will never get married.
 She told me.
 So I knew that was some kind of joke.
 So I thought that I was leading in the right direction.
 But there were very strange questions.
 Suddenly they asked me, this committee, you see, everything was fine, mathematics was
 alright, Czech language and everything was fine.
 And suddenly they said, do you?
 Do you?
 Do you display some welcoming signals during the public holidays in your window?
 Which means...
 Are you supporting communism?
 Yes.
 So I didn't know what to say.
 I was really surprised, surprised.
 I didn't know what to say.
 So I said, well, our window is aiming not at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 It's aiming at the people.
 We had been watched.
 Yes, checked out.
 Not me, but my parents.
 So they were in our vicinity.
 People who were reporting and saying,
 they are not putting a red flag or…
 It's a very vicious regime.
 But we never knew.
 That was just like the Germans.
 They were also watching everybody and the communists were not better.
 Anyway…
 Don't go away. Stay!
 So where were we now?
 So you and Agnes were courting,
 and at the end of your university degree,
 you said you got married.
 Yes.
 At the end of the university degree,
 again I had to sit in exams of discussion
 with the leading professors and so on.
 There was a whole committee around me
 and I had to tell them what's what.
 And they obviously were quite satisfied
 because then they let me go.
 And… but…
 Then…
 During that, there was sort of overlap
 because during that,
 we, Agnes and I, we decided to get married.
 So, Jero, when you say we decided,
 did you not first propose to her?
 Well, it wasn't so simple obviously.
 I did propose to her.
 And was that a…
 I proposed to her and I…
 Then I had to go to Germany.
 I had to go to her mother
 to get her permission.
 So when you…
 Did you make a romantic event to propose to her?
 Did you do something nice or…?
 I can't remember what I…
 But I…
 I…
 I…
 Was…
 I asked…
 I simply asked her whether she would have me.
 And I think she…
 I think when I asked her for the first time,
 she burst…
 I'm…
 I'm uncontrollable after,
 which I didn't…
 I found very odd.
 Oh.
 So she didn't say yes?
 She didn't say yes.
 But then…
 She didn't say no?
 She didn't say…
 Didn't say no.
 So I think I tried it next time again
 and then she said yes.
 So…
 But Jero, that was quite brave,
 to try again.
 Well, because I knew that the…
 the…
 the luck, you know what she is like.
 It was nerves.
 It was nerves?
 Yes, yes.
 She…
 She wasn't really…
 I don't know what she would have done
 had I sort of got up and disappeared.
 She was overwhelmed, probably.
 Maybe.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, so…
 so…
 that…
 that's what…
 what happened.
 And I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 I…
 And I loved her, yes.
 Anyway, so I told her what's happened,
 after all, after four years.
 She must have been relieved that the whole thing came to a good end.
 Yes.
 Anyway, so I had this, and then we decided to,
 after all this, we decided to get married
 because one of the reasons was we just couldn't get an accommodation
 without being married.
 Yes, yes.
 You know, that was very difficult with the communists,
 and what you had to do is to apply
 because all the accommodation,
 was renting or whatever,
 was controlled by the government.
 So you know, just like here, you go and say for sale,
 and you go and buy it.
 Just didn't exist like that.
 And so we, before the wedding, we were investigating,
 and Agnes, she knew, or her mother,
 I don't know who it was,
 they knew of some people who had a flat
 which would have been available.
 But we couldn't actually apply for that flat
 because we weren't married.
 Mm-hmm.
 So we decided to get married.
 And so I went to the church, which is nearby there,
 and the priest wasn't there.
 But it was his or somebody over there.
 So I said what I was after, and he said,
 okay, when would you like it?
 So I said that which was Saturday.
 And it had to be, I was still obliged to work.
 I had to work because of the government regulations.
 So I just couldn't pack it up and say I'm getting married.
 Mm-hmm.
 So I...
 And the best day at that time looked to me to be Saturday,
 a Saturday.
 Mm-hmm.
 So I agreed with this man it will be on Saturday.
 Mm-hmm.
 And made all the preparations and invited all the aunts
 and uncles and cousins and so on.
 And does Aunt Robin have to organize the party
 because she's the mother of the bride?
 Well, eventually, yes.
 She organized the party.
 She organized the...
 The reception.
 The reception.
 Mm-hmm.
 Was that in her house or...?
 No, it was in a nearby hotel in the main street.
 I can't remember what it's called, but it was very nice.
 And was it difficult to get dresses and things like that?
 Well, Agnes's dress was actually inherited after her mother.
 Oh, yeah.
 her mother and her mother had it after some grandmother from Guller.
 How fantastic, really. And do we know is that dress still around?
 Probably is.
 Oh wow.
 Ask Agnes.
 So Ludi didn't wear it?
 Maybe she did. Maybe she did, you know, I can't remember. But it was something with
 this dress.
 Lovely, beautiful.
 It was being used by various people. Anyway, so…
 Had you met her father by then?
 No.
 Had he gone away or…?
 I met him for the first time during the… we had two weddings I must say. We had a
 civil wedding.
 You had two in those days, didn't you?
 Yes, and then you had in the church.
 And then you had in the church.
 Yes.
 And so the first one had to be the state. And so we had it, you know, in Prague, Kasa,
 in the Prague square.
 Yeah.
 Where were the big clock and so on. So we went there and we agreed on wedding in there.
 And to this wedding, Agnes is…
 Agnes' father came.
 Was Agnes' father divorced from her mother?
 No.
 He just didn't live at home or…?
 Well, it was a very strange day. They never spoke to each other and it was very sort of
 strange.
 They lived together but they didn't speak?
 Yes.
 And he didn't talk to you about Agnes getting married to you or…?
 No.
 Did you ever get to know him?
 No.
 Aha.
 Well, there was a time when Agnes was married to a man.
 And he was married to a man.
 And he was married to a man.
 And he was married to a man.
 And he was married to a man.
 And he was married to a man.
 Aha.
 Well, later on, that was just shortly before his death, so then he actually came to live
 with us because he was so ill.
 In Czechoslovakia?
 Yes.
 Oh, yes.
 In Prague.
 Oh, yes.
 And so he stayed with us.
 And he became a bit friendly.
 But the first meeting with him, you know, for the wedding was something I wouldn't have
 ever wished anybody to live with.
 Was he so cold or unfriendly or…?
 Unfriendly.
 And I would say…
 Aggressive or…?
 Aggressive.
 And she called me a prince.
 You know, this prince, whatever he was doing here.
 And when we had something to eat, we would go to the restaurant and we would go to the
 restaurant.
 And we would go to the restaurant and we would go to the restaurant.
 And we would go to the restaurant.
 And we would go to the restaurant.
 And we would go to the restaurant.
 And we would go to the restaurant.
 And we would go to the restaurant.
 So he was sort of jealous, maybe he said, of course for him you would have this and for me nothing of that kind.
 Oh dear.
 It was very unpleasant, I must say. I didn't like it.
 He didn't like to talk about it because it was, it really spoiled the whole day, I would say.
 Spoiled the whole wedding?
 The whole wedding. To me.
 The civil wedding or the...?
 Both.
 Oh, how terrible, Jarrow! Your wedding was spoiled by this grumpy man.
 Yes.
 Oh, isn't that terrible? And that was the first time you met him?
 That was the first time I met him.
 So he was basically saying, you're nice to Jarrow, but you're not nice to me.
 And you said nothing back, you were just...
 Well, I didn't want to, I didn't know, I was so surprised, first of all.
 Yes.
 I didn't...
 I didn't know really what to say and how to behave and what was what.
 And then there was the question where to live, you see, because we still didn't have the flat.
 Yeah.
 So grandma kindly gave us her room in that flat in the old town.
 And so we lived for a while.
 Mm-hmm.
 We lived there.
 But did you go first for a honeymoon?
 We didn't have anything, but I couldn't afford any honeymoon.
 And also you couldn't get away from work, probably.
 But because of this, yeah.
 And Agnes was still at university?
 She was still at university.
 And so I just...
 I mean, we had the wedding on...
 That's what I like to say, the wedding.
 I decided on Saturday because...
 Mm-hmm.
 But then when the Saturday came, I went to the church to see the priest.
 And he said, who told you you can have a wedding on Saturday?
 And I said, this is a virgin.
 And he said he never told me anything.
 Oh, gosh.
 So...
 And everybody was invited and coming.
 Yes.
 And then people coming from all sorts of...
 So I was really...
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.



 Mm-hmm.




 Mm-hmm.


 Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 discuss it with me, he said.
 That was not a good start, you see.
 But then we had the father, father-in-law there,
 and that kind of thing.
 And anyway, so.
 The people who were coming,
 they didn't know they had to stay the night for Sunday.
 But of course not.
 And they didn't have anywhere to stay.
 So it was not a very good thing.
 I would like to remember for a bit,
 because that was really very bad.
 After all, the wedding day should be your best day
 or something like that.
 But even today, when I think of it,
 that was not very, very good.
 So when you actually said to everyone
 it had to be on Sunday, did they still all come?
 And they could organize the food?
 And everything just changed the day?
 And then of course it left for my mother-in-law
 to go and change the hotel where she already lived.
 Oh yes, yes, yes.
 But she managed.
 And Jaro, that's so sad.
 So your whole wedding day was blighted by this father
 and by this unhelpful priest.
 Yes.
 And what is the date of your wedding day?
 What is the, what day were you married?
 Well, I have got it written as the 26th of August.
 But that was then the church wedding.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Whereas the state wedding was I think 19th of May.
 Oh right.
 But you didn't live together as man and wife
 until your church wedding?
 That's right.
 You waited until the church wedding
 before you thought of yourself as married?
 Yes.
 And you didn't live together as a man and wife?

 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.

 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.

 No.
 No.
 No.

 No.

 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.

 No.
 But of course people knew this and so on and then Agnes got a bit fed up that on one hand she was married and on the other hand she didn't want to, you know.
 So she sort of pressed on me that we would have the wedding in August.
 And Jaro, after the wedding day, which was a bit sad, were you able to help each other? Were you able to comfort each other about what had happened?
 Were you able to talk about the father and comfort each other?
 Well my mother, you know, my grandmother, she was a bit upset as well and she, I think she even,
 Well, she didn't like it at all because she thought that he ruined the whole thing, which he did.
 And I mean, what he was thinking, I don't know, it was my parents came there to say goodbye and so on.
 So my father was there, my mother was there, my mother-in-law was there,
 and there was this father-sons-in-law, which was behaving the way he did.
 And maybe he had somebody else in mind for Agnes. That may be it, you see.
 Well, maybe he was hurt when it isn't okay with a couple,
 and then one of the couple is very nice to someone else, then you feel affronted.
 Maybe he was affronted that...
 His wife was so nice to you, but they were quarreling or something like that.
 I don't know, but it was very...
 But you stayed then in her house, so was he there?
 He was there somewhere.
 But you never sort of saw him?
 No.
 He led his own life. But did your mother-in-law comfort you?
 Did she say, don't worry, it's not you and...
 Yes, I got with them very well.
 Yeah.
 And in fact, we decided, or she also, that it just, things can go on like that.
 And so we started looking for something.
 And we found, then we found a house in Chodkowiczki, where we eventually, where we actually lived.
 And...
 And this house was...
 How shall I describe it?
 It was an old house, which needed really a lot of work and so on.
 But I didn't mind this, I could do it myself.
 And so...
 It was grandma who bought this house.
 And so we moved there and we made a sort of deal with her,
 that if she wanted it, she could live in one of the rooms.
 And which she was quite keen to do.
 That was Agnes' mother?
 That was Agnes' mother.
 And so...
 We didn't live sort of just in that Chodkowiczki.
 When was it?
 We moved there after the...
 After the...
 After the wedding, which was in August.
 And it was about April next day, next year, when we moved into that house.
 About seven months.
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 And...
 Did Agnes stay at university?
 She completed her degree.
 Yes, she completed the degree and she did very well.
 And so...
 So it...
 Everything...
 In the end, everything went all right.
 And I never saw the father for a long time, until he got really so ill,
 that he needed some help.
 So we took him into our house and then he was staying with us.
 And...
 But...
 So did you feel...
 Did you like being married?
 Oh, yes, I think I did.
 Yes, I did.
 To be...
 To be the masters of your own life...
 Yes.
 ...was kind of fun.
 And then I was lucky, actually.
 And that is with my job, you see.
 Mm-hmm.
 Because as it happened, there was a huge...
 There was a huge rain and flood in Prague...
 Mm-hmm.
 ...the following spring.
 And that actually caused quite a lot of havoc and damaged and so on.
 And I was...
 I was employed by a firm which administrated all the rivers in Prague.
 So I was, you know, I was in that...
 And so...
 After that flood, the request came from the authorities that something should be done
 with that river.
 Mm-hmm.
 So it won't be affected because...
 Mm-hmm.
 ...houses were flooded there and...
 So there was nobody who would...
 Who would make the...
 Who would do the design.
 Mm-hmm.
 And at that time, there was such a...
 The regime system...
 The regime system was that you had to write that there were firms, designing firms.
 Mm-hmm.
 And you have to write to them.
 And they would give you the job, and it would take years before they do the design.
 And so I said, I'll do it myself.
 So I think you need...
 You need good rest.
 I've suddenly got...
 My eyes are a bit heavy, but I'm not bored.
 I'm very, very interested in what you're saying, but I think I'm going to have to have a coffee.
 Okay.
 Please don't think I'm not listening.
 I'm completely, completely listening.
 Oh, no, don't worry.
 My eyes suddenly went, oh...
 I'm just going to make some coffee, Jero.
 Oh, I've lost that.
 Just a second.
 Can I get you some?
 Yes, you can.
 But look, if...
 No, honestly, Jero, I really am fine.
 I'm just going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 I'm going to...
 Well... To do an exam?
 Well, I'm just... Sorry, go...
 I can just...
 No, it was very important.
 I'm coming to it.
 But first of all, when the year...
 So, as I said, I got the permission,
 and the whole family and so on,
 to stay in England one year,
 and then after one year, we were to go to back,
 going back, which we did.
 And...
 I even went to Victoria Station to get train tickets
 because the regime, the communist regime,
 didn't allow us to fly,
 so we had to go by train.
 And so...
 First of all, I had to go to Wooloo
 and pack all the equipment and, you know,
 shoes and clothing and so on,
 and we were ready to go.
 And...
 We had to spend one night there
 because the train went...
 And anyway, which we did.
 And the following day, when I was on the day,
 supposedly, of the day of departure,
 from London to Prague...
 Are you with... Are you still with me?
 Yes, absolutely.
 So, we...
 We were getting ready to go to Victoria Station
 and take the train.
 And then from train to stand...
 And so on.
 And it took...
 It took...
 The train generally took...
 about 36 hours.
 It took very, very long.
 Anyway...
 But when I woke up and I said,
 I buy myself last English newspapers,
 so I got the book.
 And there it was that Czechoslovakia was
 invaded by the Warsaw Pact.
 And the Warsaw Pact forces.
 And I'm sure you heard this.
 Because they felt that the regime was too liberal.
 And so they were coming in to put the boot down.
 Yes.
 Ah.
 And so what actually did happen was that
 I didn't know what to do.
 You see, there I was.
 The day before that,
 I had a big celebration with the firm.
 Telling them goodbye and things like that.
 And they gave me a powder pen.
 And that kind of thing.
 So...
 And in Wüller, of course,
 with Anka James and so...
 So we were going home.
 And suddenly this kind of news
 appeared in the newspapers.
 So...
 And because, as you know, the newspapers,
 you don't know what to believe sometimes.
 So I decided to go to Kensington Gardens
 where is the Czechoslovak embassy.
 And so we went there, all of us.
 And I asked, you know, what is happening?
 And they said,
 oh, it was such a pandemonium.
 You just can't imagine.
 In that office.
 And they basically told us,
 if you don't go anywhere,
 unless you absolutely have to.
 Because the frontiers are closed.
 The buses don't run.
 The trains are not running or anything.
 And you may get trapped somewhere,
 stranded somewhere in Germany.
 So if you have nowhere to stay,
 stay there.
 And this is how it all started, you see.
 We went...
 So I went back to the same firm.
 There was still...
 Still the drawing board,
 which I didn't quite complete,
 was still there.
 So they said,
 you can finish this off maybe.
 And then we rented,
 because we still weren't quite sure what was what.
 So we rented temporarily a flat for the children.
 And Agnes...
 And...
 So...
 And how the whole thing actually started.
 Then we, of course,
 when being a civil engineer,
 you get more and more involved in design work
 and project and calculations and so on.
 And the more difficult it is to leave all this.
 And so I...
 just asked for my road to Prague.
 To my...
 You know, the Prague employer.
 And they explained the situation.
 And I asked them if I could stay
 and ask for another year.
 And they gave me one year, you see.
 And that was already...
 The situation was entirely different.
 You see, you got the Dukček there and...
 And...
 And...
 Was Dukček very right-wing?
 Or...
 Yes.
 So he was...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 He was a very...
 So he was coming down on everybody much stronger?
 Yes.
 Okay. But they still gave you another year?
 They still gave me another year.
 I'm amazed.
 So I tried my luck. I thought they gave me one year.
 And so I got permission from Prague and so I went back to John Taylor's again and they said you just continue with your work.
 Were they welcoming? Were they pleased?
 Yes.
 Wonderful.
 They were very pleased.
 And by then you could speak English?
 By then I could speak English a bit more than before.
 And so...
 Yes.
 So I stayed there one year.
 And this was, as I've said, you know, with civil engineering once you stay somewhere longer...
 You get involved.
 You get involved and it's difficult to leave.
 And this is what happened with me.
 I got jobs, marvelous jobs, in...on Isle of Wight and other...
 And so when that year, the next year expired...
 I wrote them and that was for another year.
 The cheques, you see, which was a bit cheeky of me.
 But could I just check before you go on?
 You'd left behind a house and a mother-in-law and was there somebody looking after the house and all your possessions and...
 My parents.
 Oh, you had everything.
 So you felt as if everything was being cared for?
 It wasn't like it was all just exposed.
 It was safe.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 My parents were looking after this.
 But then I...
 So you asked for a third year?
 Yes, but before that my mother died.
 Oh, dear.
 So I...
 Was that very unexpected or...
 Yes.
 Did she have a heart attack or...?
 She had...
 She had...
 A very close vein.
 A very close vein.
 She was actually in London visiting us about a month before that.
 Oh, right.
 So you'd had a chance to see her.
 So we saw her.
 And her sister.
 With her sister.
 But then when she returned, somehow she had to go.
 She had this very close vein in her legs.
 And so she went to hospital in Prague.
 And during this operation suddenly she died.
 And so that was a bit of a shock.
 How old was she?
 What?
 Fifty-six.
 She was young!
 No, she was very young.
 Same as my mummy died at fifty-six.
 But was the same thing?
 Oh, my goodness.
 Oh, dear, oh, dear.
 That's a very big shock.
 Yes.
 And then she died.
 Yes.
 And then she died.
 Yes.
 And then she died.
 Yes.
 That was a big shock.
 And so that's how it all happened.
 And then after I got the extension another year, so then I asked for another one, you
 see.
 Of course they didn't agree.
 They checked.
 Didn't agree.
 And they said, you must come back straight away.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 And then I got the extension.
 I meant to say that I was not coming back.
 But Jaro, what was it like for you to leave your country?
 Well it...
 Was it a trauma?
 Well, it wasn't.
 Because, because it, the way it happened.
 It was gradual.
 It was gradual.
 And also there were such positive things happening.
 That's right.
 That you felt that it was something beautiful to do this new thing.
 That's right.
 Not be under the communist regime and...
 Yes.
 That's right.
 And so, so I decided, but maybe it was the children, you see, because the only boy and
 they were already in George Watson's here and studying very well.
 And were you living in Edinburgh by then?
 Yes.
 In the house that I know?
 Yes.
 In that flat down the road?
 Yes.
 That's right.
 That's 1970, I think.
 So...
 So, so this is how it all happened.
 But did it mean that your family got into any trouble because you had done that?
 They did.
 What happened then?
 Well, there was during my absence, there was a court case against me.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 And I was in the house.
 against me and where my father was invited to as a witness my sister was there and but nothing
 happened to them except that they gave me nine months imprisonment if you came back
 if they could get hold of you yes and did they take away all your property
 yes so your father and couldn't save anything he couldn't get anything out of the house that
 was precious to you or well whatever they what they managed to save even with the mother against
 his mother they managed to save something and what you see here actually was taken from out of
 our house oh good good okay so but but you lost the property that you owned your house and
 that's right and um was it easy to get a visa to stay here
 i mean was it difficult for you to say i want to become a british
 well i had to i had to apply for a citizen so did you apply for that after you told the people you
 weren't coming home yes so that was a risk you've burned your boat yes yes it's uh the the law said
 that you have to stay in this country at least five years and then i can apply and so that's
 what i did i waited until those five years and then i wrote and applied and two two chaps came to
 ask and to investigate what was hot and so we had a nice chat with them and and then some lawyer some
 came into my office and i had to slide to the queen and and and
 i i got the british citizenship oh did you and um so was agnes already a british citizen because you
 had a yes you had dual nationality and it was it was clear that you were not a burden to the state
 yes okay so by the time you finally became a british citizen
 you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen and you were a british citizen
 recap about Jero building a house in Czechoslovakia.
 It happened in 1965 when we decided to build a legal summer house in the northern part
 of Czechoslovakia and we were wondering how to do it and so on.
 Eventually we found a family whom we, or grandma actually, knew.
 Her name was Stelik.
 And uh…
 In the north.
 In the north.
 And so that's how it happened.
 And then we started to build a house in Czechoslovakia.
 And we were wondering how to do it.
 And that must have been 1965 or 1966.
 I can't really remember exactly.
 But the point is that I started building this in the springtime, just after Easter of that
 year.
 So you bought a bit of land?
 Yes, I bought a bit of land.
 And then I had plans for the particular house.
 And then…
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 I had a house.
 It'll be in there so we can look it up afterwards.
 But anyway...
 And the wood came by train.
 Yes, it was actually prefabricated units.
 Oh yes, yes, wonderful.
 And they came from Russia.
 Oh wow.
 Which means the wood came, but it was what we got,
 which was pieces of wood which I had to put together
 and cut to suit and things like that.
 And the foundations were stone foundations.
 So it was really properly built.
 And we finished...
 I finished...
 I should say I finished because I spent most of the time
 doing it myself every weekend.
 I just went up there.
 It's about 100 kilometers north of Prague.
 Wow, quite a long way.
 Yes.
 What was the place called?
 Vransko.
 V-R-A-N-S-K-O.
 Vransko.
 And it's in the mountains.
 There is actually somebody...
 Graham was persuaded, some painter,
 to make a picture of that.
 Wonderful.
 So that's still recorded.
 But unfortunately,
 it was all confiscated
 when I decided not to go back.
 And do you happen to know who lives there now?
 Or have you been to see it since?
 Well, I've been there once.
 But it's many years ago.
 I don't know who it is just now.
 It was taken over by some club.
 Oh, I see.
 Of woodworkers.
 And Jeroen, was that really hard for you
 to lose that house that you built yourself?
 It was.
 And there's no way that you can get something like that back
 after the war came down.
 Well, I tried.
 You see, after the fall of communism,
 I applied not only for this,
 but also for our house where we lived.
 But the thing is, various things did happen.
 And that is that these people who will live there,
 they bought it from some authorities,
 which means they paid some money.
 And therefore they were reluctant to give it away
 without getting the money back.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 And, you know, this was the problem.
 Yeah.
 They didn't have enough money in the state
 to pay reparations.
 Reparations.
 Yeah, okay.
 So you just had to live there.
 That was the Frag house.
 So I just decided to live there.
 I just decided to let it go,
 which was not so easy.
 No.
 But there's, you know, there's that famous, famous book
 by Charles Dickens called Bleak House,
 where somebody doesn't decide to let something go,
 and they go to court and go to court and go to court,
 and it just ruins your life.
 So you want to get on with your life.
 My way of thinking is, yeah,
 I was just thinking that it is true.
 But secondly, the children,
 I'm not really interested in the day like it here,
 and so that kind of thing.
 So, but it doesn't do you much good, really.
 It's hard.
 It's really hard.
 It's very hard.
 I think you've had to cope with some pretty big things,
 really, you and Agnes, in your lives.
 But...
 Because I spent a lot of work.
 First of all, this cottage,
 I built it.
 I built it really much just with my hands.
 There was no farm in existence.
 And I had some old man living in the area
 who would come to, you know, to help me.
 But otherwise, nothing.
 But it's...
 I was quite pleased when it was all finished.
 I was quite pleased when it was done.
 You know, how many years did you have of enjoying it?
 How many years staying in it, visiting?
 Not really.
 Very short.
 One year or something.
 Not even that.
 Because when I went to this country,
 thinking it would be only temporary,
 so that was not really livable yet.
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
 So you basically built it,
 and then never really had much of a time there.
 No.
 I remember we were there once,
 and the fire was on, and it was very nice.
 Oh.
 That was one occasion.
 You mean a proper log fire?
 Yes.
 Oh, yes.
 There was a fire there.
 Wonderful.
 Yes, I built a fireplace there.
 You just saw this one.
 Mm-hmm.
 It was quite nice.
 It wouldn't have been once
 when already Agnes and I
 and the children were here.
 So I went to have a look at it
 with grandma, your mother.
 And there was about this depth of snow,
 because it's high in the mountains.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 So it would have been for children skiing,
 for instance.
 Oh, yes, wonderful.
 That would have been wonderful.
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 But...
 But meanwhile, your mother-in-law was still there.
 She was still there.
 She was still...
 Even when we decided not to go back,
 she was still there.
 And was she supportive?
 She was quite supportive.
 She didn't say,
 Oh, please come back.
 She said, I understand.
 No, she never said that.
 But she didn't live in our house.
 She lived in a flat of her own.
 Oh, yes.
 But was your father very sad
 that you didn't come home?
 Funnily enough, he didn't say anything much either.
 You know, he didn't say,
 Come back.
 Nobody, nobody ever asked me to come back.
 Do you think that they had enough generosity
 to want you to do what you really needed to do?
 Yes.
 Because it was horrible to live under communism.
 They knew that.
 They knew that.
 Yeah.
 And so...
 So...
 So...
 Well, my father,
 he got very ill.
 And then later on,
 it was possible to visit him.
 So he saw our children,
 you know, the girls went to see him
 and see this, this,
 and that's my father.
 Ah, wonderful.
 She's so clever, isn't she?
 Amazing.
 So where would you like to go next?
 I think I'd go from here,
 because you've now got British citizenship.
 You're living in that lovely house
 in Thurlston Road, was it?
 Yes.
 And you...
 The kids are at school.
 And so what was your next great step in life?
 What happened then that was important?
 Well, I should say that, yeah.
 I was...
 I was...
 I was...
 I was...
 I worked in Edinburgh here
 as sort of permanent basis.
 I left John Taylor's.
 Oh, yes.
 And I joined
 the corporation,
 they called it Edinburgh Corporation.
 And we built,
 when you see this,
 beautifully clean estuary.
 This is part of my job as well.
 Wonderful.
 Anyway, and so...
 Well, this was...
 had to be finished,
 not like anything else.
 So when it was finished,
 I was wondering what to do.
 And John Taylor,
 you know, the previous employer,
 they came to me and they said,
 look, you've got this job in Abu Dhabi.
 Would you like to join us?
 So...
 I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 And they said, yes.
 And I said, yes.
 They have the most of the oil. But they are not so clever with money and so on, like the
 shirkin Dubai. This is why you don't hear so much from Abu Dhabi.
 Oh yes.
 You just hear it from... Anyway, so...
 What did they want you to do there?
 Well, they were building treatment plant for Abu Dhabi.
 And you can see, when you go to our kitchen, you can see part of it, part of the plant,
 which I was responsible for.
 So I went there for three years.
 Which was really something...
 It was a wonderful experience.
 So where did you live? Did you have your own flat?
 Yes. You know, the farm, it's a different world. You see, they gave me a car, they gave
 me a flat. And so I was okay.
 And what was the... Who were the people... I mean, who did you meet?
 Who did you spend your time with? Were there lots of English people or...?
 Yes, there were quite a number of... I mean, the whole firm, John Taylor and Sons, was
 there. And...
 Did you live all next door to each other on an estate or...?
 Not necessarily. It just depends how the flats became available.
 Oh, I see.
 And so I got... I changed it twice, didn't I? Or three times?
 Oh, I see.
 Anyway, so I got... To begin with, I got a flat, a two bedroom flat, which was very
 good and comfortable and there are so many places to eat. So, you know, the life was...
 You didn't eat at home, you went out?
 I went out.
 Mm.
 And what sort of things did you eat for breakfast in Abu Dhabi?
 Oh, cornflakes.
 Oh, just normal European food?
 Just normal. Everything what you got here, you got there and more.
 Oh, I see. And so there were shops just for foreigners or for everyone?
 For everyone.
 Oh, yes. Okay.
 You could get... You could get absolutely anything there.
 And was it a place where you're not allowed to drink?
 Yes.
 So...
 But...
 Yeah.
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 But...
 So you didn't have to do that in secret?
 Well, you were not allowed to drink it in the open.
 Oh, break-break.
 You had to bring it home from the shop.
 Oh, yes, yes, yes.
 And were there clubs where you could drink?
 Clubs and hotels?
 Yeah.
 So you were allowed, but I don't really give it too much.
 I remember one year you brought a bottle of whiskey, Scottish whiskey, back here.
 So were you away from the family then?
 I was away from the family, which wasn't so good.
 And how much of the year were you away?
 Three years.
 So they didn't see you for three years?
 Oh, they did.
 Oh, I see.
 They could, you know, there was a provision for holidays and so they could visit Abu Dhabi for Easter and Christmas.
 For Christmas, I always went home.
 So I was here.
 So did you all go to Abu Dhabi?
 Yes.
 But I always went for a few days or something, not for a long time.
 Oh, yes.
 Yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 Whatever the Easter, I got free flight tickets.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 For the family.
 John came.
 Ludie came.
 Ines, I don't know.
 I don't know.
 No, Ines.
 Ines was too small, so she didn't come.
 Agnes came.
 Mm-hmm.
 And so, so.
 Helen came.
 Helen came, yes.
 So there was always somebody there.
 And you were always there?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 That was the problem.
 And even the other problem was the heat, the weather.
 50 degrees Celsius.
 The weather was fortunately, well it was actually fortunate, was that the timing.
 You see we had such a stiff time to finish the job.
 So there was no free time.
 You could just get on with it and not sit and think about being lonely or hot.
 Just get on with it.
 Did you have air conditioning and things like that?
 Oh yes.
 I got air conditioning everywhere.
 Air conditioning in the car, air conditioning in my flat, air conditioning in my office.
 And did you like your colleagues?
 Yes.
 They were alright.
 They were alright.
 Yes.
 And did you get to know anything about the culture?
 No.
 The culture.
 You see there are very few people sort of local.
 I know there are these sheikhs and so on.
 But they are usually cocooned in somewhere.
 Yes.
 Completely different sort of life.
 Different life.
 And you were living in the same place?

 Yes.
 And are the ordinary people very poor?
 They are usually very poor.
 Yes.
 And so could you see big contrasts?
 Between the sheikhs and the poor people.
 Yes.
 But the sheikhs, they were really clever enough to keep them quiet.
 They gave them pretty sort of hefty handouts.
 Oh yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 And you were very quiet.
 Yes.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 I was very quiet.
 So the poor people were not really so poor.
 They got help if they were ill.
 But they liked it. They were really Bedouins.
 Oh yes, yes, really. So they were allowed to travel?
 Yes, they were allowed to move.
 So it was a Bedouin culture?
 Yes.
 But then there were modern cities?
 Modern cities.
 And what was the industry? There was oil.
 Oil, that's all. The rest was all imported.
 And is this the place where lots and lots of people come from India to work?
 Yes, that's what I was thinking.
 There were many Indians.
 Balmuchi?
 No, they are not Indians.
 Oh, Balmuchi.
 I don't know whether they are from Balmuchi. Where are they from?
 They come from somewhere from Pakistan.
 Oh, I see. Okay. So now I think we have to just download again.
 They did all the gardening in the street.
 Swallowing the trees.
 So everything was really carefully looked after?
 Yes, everything was very carefully looked after and looked nice and you felt safe and all those things.
 Did you say you were there for three or five years?
 Three.
 Three, okay. So Jara is just going to start speaking about Abu Dhabi.
 I spent three years in Abu Dhabi supervising the construction of a very large wastewater treatment plant.
 And it was a very interesting job to do. Very expensive too because that plant was producing actually nearly drinking water quality.
 Whereas sometimes we never go as far as that because it costs money.
 And the whole scheme was very interesting from that point of view.
 The wastewater had to be pumped from Abu Dhabi all the way up the hill which is called Mafraq.
 And at Mafraq the wastewater is treated and aerated.
 And then it was used for the water treatment.
 And all sorts of things.
 And in the end the clean water is being discharged and returned back to Abu Dhabi.
 And in Abu Dhabi it's used for irrigation purposes.
 So when you go to Abu Dhabi today you will see a very green part of the town.
 Because that water is being used for irrigating palm trees.
 And grass and so forth.
 So that's...
 Otherwise it's nothing special about it.
 The only thing I would like to say is that the climate is very harsh.
 And I have noticed that some people were not able to bear the...
 The heat.
 And some people I remember a colleague of mine.
 He came and he went over the following day because he just...
 Couldn't face it.
 He couldn't face it.
 Otherwise it's a very pleasant place.
 Very rich of course.
 And is it always that hot?
 It doesn't have seasons.
 Well it is much cooler in winter.
 Oh yes, yes.
 In November and January and that kind of...
 It's much cooler.
 But it is very hot.
 It gets very hot already in say April.
 And it just continues.
 And we had for instance a result of concrete mixing involved in our construction.
 And for this you need really the right conditions because otherwise the setting of the concrete could be much faster than you need in the summer.
 Because of the...
 Because of the cold...
 Because of the hot weather.
 And the other thing is...
 What one has to watch is that hot climate.
 It's also very humid.
 And it tucks all the reinforcement steel bars.
 Oh yes.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 And they rust.
 I saw some walls or some construction where the steel rust actually tore the concrete about.
 So this is another thing.
 Otherwise it's very pleasant.
 Abu Dhabi initially was a town of pearl hunters.
 Oh yes. Women diving into the water.
 Diving into the water, putting pegs on and looking for pearls.
 It was done by women. All women.
 I'm not so sure about that.
 I am.
 What you did in the mansion?
 In the difficult conditions that the workmen, when they worked on the project, how they had to suffer heat.
 Yes. On that treatment plant worked about a thousand South Koreans.
 And they came just for one year.
 Isn't it amazing?
 Yes.
 But they would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 They would like to live there.
 air-conditioned? Well, you can't if you are working on the site outside.
 There is no, maybe in their huts they have air conditioning, but
 actually working on the site you can't provide this kind of facility.
 What language do they speak? Korean? Korean. So that they have somebody
 interpreting for you. And had they any skills? Oh yes, they were extremely hard people,
 hard-working people and they had the skill, they could do anything. The only
 thing which they couldn't do was plastering and rendering. So for this
 there were some places because part of this part of the scheme or the plant
 were also buildings.
 Kitchen and laboratories and things like that. So for this we had people from
 Pakistan. They were very very good at it. Was it all men? They were all men, no women.
 So what did they do? Because they must have wanted to meet women and have some
 kind of comfort and warmth. They had to postpone it till they went home. There was no question of
 that. They just stayed there and worked? They stayed there and worked.
 They didn't know it. It's really a very tough and difficult, difficult job. And the regime of work was
 for instance that we worked 13 days out of 14. So we had 13 consecutive days
 hard work. Then one day off, so to speak. Was that some different calendar or just
 because you had to get on? You had to get on. It was to do with getting everything moving.
 But that's a long time without break, isn't it? That's, if you are there, you do what the
 Sheikh says. Yes. And the Sheikh pays the money. Okay. And so the Sheikh said I want to have this
 done in two years time. And that actually governs the schedule. The schedule. So
 we had, they have it really very good, controlled. The money supply and the money flow. And I had
 to go and visit the client at least once a month. Yeah. And to show them how much money
 we need. And the client was not the Sheikh? The client, well the top client was the Sheikh.
 But you spoke to a manager or? And they were also, they were the Sheikh. And they were
 the Sheikh. And they were also, they were the Sheikh. And they were also, they were
 the Sheikh. And they were also, they were the Sheikh. And they were also, they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh. And they were the Sheikh.
 Then I gave him, it was so hot, so I took him to my office and gave him a cup of tea.
 And suddenly he said, asked me if I would allow him to use a telephone.
 So I said, of course.
 He was the client and he was...
 So he lifted the telephone.
 I couldn't believe my ears.
 There was this most beautiful polish coming out of his mouth.
 Polish?
 Polish.
 Sudanese.
 Oh!
 He was a Sudanese and the Sudanese sent many, you know, to Warsaw and then someone to study civil engineering.
 Oh, even to Czech Republic?
 And so he...
 He married some Polish girl.
 Oh!
 And it was so...
 And that was before the...
 Before the fall of communism.
 Before the fall, yes.
 It was 1970, before the fall of communism.
 And you were allowed to marry a Sudanese man if you were behind the Iron Curtain.
 I'm amazed.
 Well, anyway, there she was.
 And I was even, we got rather friendly and he...
 So he invited me to his house.
 So I went to his house and who do I see?
 Is the...
 The terribly blonde wife.
 Oh, the terribly black man.
 Terribly black man who was sitting in the corner and smoking hubbly-bubbly.
 Yes.
 And one...
 Mother-in-law was there.
 I went there.
 Say it.
 Anyway, so that was very strange.
 But they were quite nice people, you know.
 This...
 Mm-hmm.
 His...
 They spoke English.
 Oh, perfect.
 Mm-hmm.
 Perfect.
 And did they have children?
 Oh, yes.
 Beautiful children.
 Chocolate brown.
 Oh.
 Not that brown, not light blonde.
 Curly hair.
 Right.
 Curly hair and admiring the father who was smoking hubbly-bubbly in the corner.
 But the hubbly-bubbly wasn't marijuana.
 I don't know what it was, but not really.
 It must just be an Arab way of smoking tobacco.
 Yes, they have it normally.
 Yeah.
 So, Yaro, that project got completed.
 That project got completed, and so they...
 Did you have a big party?
 And you meet the sheep?
 We had a big party.
 And, of course, everything continues.
 I could have stayed there for another...
 But I did it three years, so it was just about enough.
 Yeah.
 So...
 Did you meet the sheep at the party?
 No, they wouldn't come there, I think.
 You didn't have a sort of opening, and the sheep come and give you a hawk and ask you...
 No, no, he didn't give me...
 I got no hawk.
 No lovely racehorse.
 But it was a good place for parties, which I don't really like very much.
 And the expatriates, they...
 They have forever party.
 Yes, yes, I remember that from Africa.
 And so, after this, I went to Dublin.
 Now, hold on.
 This is quite extraordinary.
 So, you're living in Abu Dhabi, the hottest, driest place in the world.
 And was it John Taylor again?
 It was still John Taylor.
 They said to you...
 They said, would you...
 There is a job on effort in Dublin.
 Would you like to go there?
 Ah.
 So I said yes.
 The most beautiful country in the world.
 Right.
 And so I went to Dublin.
 And again, we had to rent a...
 At this time, Agnes went with me.
 Were the kids all gone by then?
 They were all gone.
 So I've all gone.
 And so she was...
 Agnes was with us.
 And also my mother-in-law visited us for some longer stretches.
 And so that was very nice.
 And I like Ireland.
 I liked very much.
 How long were you there?
 Again, about three years.
 And you rented accommodation?
 I rented accommodation.
 And you lived in Czechoslovakia?
 Yes.
 And did Aunt Robin live in that flat?
 Yes.
 And so you always knew that was safe and that the kids had somewhere to go.
 But how had Aunt Robin got to England by then, Scotland by then?
 Oh.
 Well, I took her...
 What happened there?
 I took her to Scotland.
 That happened several years before that.
 What made her decide to leave Czechoslovakia?
 Because of us.
 She wanted to be near you.
 She wanted to be with the grandchildren.
 And so that was really...
 I tell you all that.
 She...
 At that time it was somehow possible to communicate by telephone.
 So I phoned her.
 And we agreed that we would meet...
 That she would go at a certain day and a certain time.
 And that she would arrive at the Czech.
 Of the German frontier at a certain day at a certain time.
 In her car.
 And I would wait for her and take her here.
 You mean she was fleeing or she was allowed to come?
 She was allowed to come.
 So...
 And was she allowed to bring her possessions?
 Yes.
 Oh, good.
 Mm-hmm.
 Why was she allowed to come?
 Because she had English relations.
 Yes.
 And they let her bring her money and her possessions.
 Yes.
 And she was allowed to come.
 And she was allowed to bring her possessions and to sell her flat.
 And so she didn't have to lose everything to come.
 That's right.
 Oh, I'm so glad.
 And so I...
 I was based in the United Borough.
 Mm-hmm.
 You know, in our flat.
 And one day I took a train to London.
 And the whole night...
 I was on a night train.
 I can't sleep at night.
 And then in London I hopped on another train and went to Dover.
 And from Dover I went to Ostend.
 And from Ostend I went to Mainz.
 And from Mainz then I went to the Czech frontier.
 That was the plan.
 Nice.
 You can...
 It was just before the war.
 It was just before the war.
 And you were...
 You were in the Czech Republic.
 Yes.
 And you were in the Czech Republic.
 Yes.
 It was just before Christmas.
 Therefore pitch dark everywhere.
 And eventually I got there, to the frontier, absolutely half dead because of not sleeping.
 Yeah.
 And so then I came to the frontier and asking when...
 You know, when the...
 It was Mrs. Samson.
 Not yet, but we'll ask.
 But it's amazing the amount of communication between those two sides.
 Anyway, they said, oh, she's not ready yet.
 So we'll have a cup of coffee.
 So I said, and had a cup of coffee.
 And that was about one o'clock.
 Agreed that we would meet at one o'clock.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And I said, I'm going to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 And then I went to the frontier.
 So we'll have a cup of coffee. So I said, and had a cup of coffee.
 That was about one o'clock. Agreed that we would meet at one o'clock.
 In a day? In a day.
 And the train, which then continued to the Czech Republic, but I couldn't.
 I had to leave the train at the railway station.
 So I sat down and had one coffee.
 After one hour or two, I had the second coffee.
 Then I had another coffee. And then I had another coffee.
 And then suddenly a fast car arrived.
 And that was a taxi driver.
 And he just returned from the other, from the Czech part.
 And said, there is a woman on the other side.
 And the place is full of violin.
 Violins.
 That was our grandpa.
 And so there was nothing I could do about it.
 But he went there with his wife, the taxi driver.
 And the plot was that he would actually bring grandma in there.
 Because she couldn't drive.
 She had a car, but she was unable to drive it.
 Oh dear.
 And her friend took her to the front door.
 The front door.
 A Czech friend.
 Some Czech took her to the front door.
 And then she was on her own.
 On the other side, it was me.
 But just no man's land.
 She needed someone to take her.
 And this is where this taxi driver came into it, you see.
 What's that like?
 So eventually, it was about seven o'clock.
 They appeared.
 Grandma was there.
 Grandma was there.
 And she was absolutely, the state she was in, that was terrible.
 Because they heard that, you know, the Czech gods.
 And they gave her really a bad, really bad.
 They threw everything out of the car onto the ground.
 Any bit of paper they collected and checked.
 And if there was our name on it, they confiscated it.

 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.

 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Oh dear.
 Well, she was really illegal, you see, they had no right to do this.
 But this is how they treated her and she was in no state to argue.
 Well, anyway, suddenly she appeared.
 And you see the Czechs, they not only confiscated her or whatever,
 but also they stole her number plates.
 Number plates.
 So she arrived and the car was completely naked.
 So I thought to myself, I said,
 well, you can't drive across Germany just like that without number plates.
 And so I went to the German office, it was on the German side of the road.
 I went to the German office and I said, look, and I explained the problem.
 And he said,
 he's sort of reached down below and pulled out number plates.
 Oh, yes.
 So he really wanted to help you.
 He really wanted to help me and I had to pay him about 25 Deutsche Marks.
 And so I fitted them on and off we went.
 And it was so late.
 Then I was worried because I had the ferry booked.
 In Ostaden.
 So we were driving and grandma was slowly cooling down.
 And eventually we, apart from one incident in Belgium,
 where I couldn't get petrol.
 And it was about 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning.
 The ferry was to go at 7.
 And, and,
 you probably heard her.
 You got there.
 You got there.
 An hour, you got an hour in hand.
 Oh, yes, we got there.
 But I had to make a detour.
 You see that I was on the motorway and the motorway takes you straight to Ostaden.
 But because I had no petrol, I suddenly realized I wouldn't get there because there was not enough petrol.
 So I made a detour to,
 there is a little town.
 Near to Ostaden.
 Near to Ostaden.
 I don't remember enough about,
 you don't remember the name?
 I do remember but I can't remember his name.
 I know, never mind.
 We'll add it later.
 So you stopped and got petrol.
 So we stopped and got petrol and got, just in time we got to,
 Got onto the ferry.
 Got onto the ferry.
 And as soon as I sat down in the ferry, I fell asleep.
 Because I hadn't had sleep for several nights.
 Oh dear, dear, dear.
 Because of trains and,
 Because of the trains.
 Because of the train.
 Because of the train.

 Because of the train.
 and one day because we were rather tired from it,
 so was grandma.
 So the next day we went to Leicester Square
 and they had most beautiful steak which grandma liked.
 Sorry, I'm so sorry.
 Ever sleep, ever sleep.
 I think I need 10 minutes again.
 You must understand that if I go to sleep,
 it's not because of you.
 I know, yeah, I know.
 So hold on, we're in London, driving home,
 and you are running out of petrol.
 Running out of petrol.
 From Antwerp, we drove to Ostend, boarded the ferry,
 and the ferry took us to Dover.
 And from Dover, we drove to London,
 and we didn't go any further because we were so tired.
 And so we went to Leicester Square
 and drank some steak.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 I can't remember what steak it was,
 but she talked about it for a long time.
 It was very good steak.
 It was a very good steak.
 It is, it is.
 And so we stayed there overnight,
 and the next day we set off,
 and we drove all the way without stopping to Wooler.
 Goodness me.
 And in Wooler, there was, who was in Wooler?
 Uncle James and Aunt Edma,
 and when they saw grandma, our grandma,
 so they were very happy.
 They were very happy.

 They were very happy. They were very happy.
 They were very happy. They were very happy.

 They were very happy. They were very happy.
 They were very happy. They were very happy.
 They were very happy. They were very happy.
 They were very happy. They were very happy.
 They were very happy. They were very happy.
 sort of dancing with joy and kissing each other and we had a tea and and but then it was soon it
 was time to go home so we continued and we drove to Edinburgh where we knew it very well and we
 just came here at the corner of of the street where we are now where we are just now get my
 had her look at it and she said I know this is very well I used to stay here with my grandmother
 you wouldn't believe that of all the streets in Edinburgh we had to choose just the one she knew
 and and Margaret hadn't known that when she suggested that flat because I thought Margaret
 found that flat yes she did and she read an advertisement and she never mentioned anything oh
 isn't that funny
 it is anyway so we took her home number 25 and uh to go into the flat that I know yes
 and we took her to the third floor unloaded the car and uh that all children were there of course
 Johnny boy and Ludy and did she sleep in the room that I always sleep slept in yes and the big big
 room yes was that like a bedroom and the sitting room yes she turned it into a bedroom and the
 sitting room that's right no it was it was very nice it's a pity we had to leave it because of
 because it was too high up I don't understand how you all fitted in where was the room for everybody
 I don't understand what the other bedroom was there was the bedroom that you and Agnes were in
 the bedroom that I used to stay in, then there's another little bedroom.
 But John?
 So where were the girls?
 They were in the front. Between the sitting room and the grandma's bedroom there was another room and they had a double bed.
 I don't remember that other room.
 So it had four bedrooms that house?
 Yeah.
 Oh right, I didn't remember that other room.
 Anyway, you all fitted in?
 We all fitted in.
 You must have had to have extreme organisation around bathrooms.
 Well that was the problem.
 Yeah, everybody in the morning had to get somewhere in time.
 We never had any fight.
 Well things like that, isn't it?
 No fisticuffs.
 So she arrived and all of the kids were there and you were there and a whole new life began with, she was called Roberta, not Robin, but Roberta.
 Roberta Secunda because there was another child called Roberta that died.
 Yes.
 So, okay.
 Yeah, she is.
 That's how it was.
 And, no she spent how many happy years there?
 I think this happened in 72, did it?
 72? She came here.
 Yes.
 And she died in 92.
 So she spent 20 years there.
 And I visited Edinburgh to work.
 And you were by then gone to Constantinople.
 And I spent time with her and Aunt Margaret.
 And they were going to the art gallery to study Poussin.
 And they took me for lunch in the big store opposite the lovely hotel on Princess Street.
 And my friend who was with me, the older lady, she was there.
 She said to me, now I've met your relations, now I understand why you are like you are.
 What you caught.
 She always couldn't understand.
 She thought that I was very vivid.
 And then she met Aunt Margaret and Aunt Robin and she said, I see the family is vivid.
 And that's nice, isn't it?
 I was very pleased about that.
 But Jero, that was a kind of recap.
 You've actually got back from Abu Dhabi and you've decided to go and work in Dublin.
 And the children have all gone into the world.
 And you and Agnes are renting a flat.
 A flat in Dublin.
 Whereabouts in Dublin?
 In...
 Dun Laoghaire.
 Dun Laoghaire.
 Was it out of town?
 Nearly.
 It was a big court.
 So it was in a...
 What kind of building was it?
 A modern building?
 It was a villa.
 It was a nice, very...
 Oh, beautiful.
 Beautiful.
 Nice architecture and everything.
 Yeah.
 Very nice.
 And a big garden.
 And the owner are very nice people.
 We still are in touch with them and...
 Yeah.
 What is...
 He was a great sailor.
 What was your job in...
 What were you doing in...
 Tandering.
 Tandering.
 Yes.
 And you were a sailor.
 Yes.
 And you were a sailor.
 Yes.
 And you were a sailor.
 Yes.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 And you were a sailor.
 between three water waves.
 One was Liffey, the other one was Dodoy, and third was the sea.
 So between these three we had to build.
 Therefore it was very difficult because it was so much water,
 we just couldn't normally pump it, or you could use a compressor,
 that kind of thing to give water.
 But this was not really possible, so the miners, they were there up to here.
 They ended the whole shift.
 Were they Irish?
 They were Irish. Very nice people.
 And really the Irish,
 it was the best client I have ever worked for.
 Why is that? What was it about them?
 They were so nice and so understanding.
 Yes, they were the nicest people I have ever worked for.
 Were they warm-hearted? Was it the sort of warmth of heart?
 Warm-hearted and...
 We still write to the widow of the boss that was supervising the...
 It's...
 Yes, I have very good memories for Dublin.
 Of course, Dublin itself, it's a very beautiful town.
 Perfect.
 And the hills around.
 So how many years were you there?
 Three years, I think.
 And did you get a kind of extraordinary culture shock?
 From desert to green and...
 Yes, yes, yes, that's right.
 But a sort of lovely culture shock.
 Lovely culture shock.
 Beautiful experience.
 No, it was something entirely different.
 It was really very nice and the people so nice and...
 We travelled a lot across here and there at weekends.
 And there is so much to see from the culture point of view, from history.
 Prehistory.
 Prehistory.
 There's so much to see there.
 And lovely gardens and garden estates and very nice...
 What was going on in Ireland at that time with the IRA?
 It was the IRA and then Bobby Sand.
 So that was all going on, but in the other side?
 Well, Bobby Sand was in Dublin, wasn't he, or something?
 Oh, was he?
 I don't know.
 Embrace...
 He was on the...
 In Dublin?
 In Dublin.
 Oh, how frightening.
 And then he died, actually.
 Yeah, yeah.
 He just refused to eat.
 And that was really very unpleasant.
 Yeah.
 But otherwise...
 Otherwise, not that I would go back any time.
 Right.
 They were trying to...
 They somehow liked me.
 Also, one of the...
 From the Ministry, he was trying to persuade me to stay in Ireland.
 Oh, yes?
 And to live in Kerry.
 Oh, yes.
 And to live in Kerry.
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 And to live in...
 to live in Kerry. Oh yes. And he even started negotiating and there was some place or job for me
 to do it. But at the same time I got this offer from Istanbul which I couldn't refuse. And who
 made that offer? Not John Taylor again? John Taylor again. So it was the Irish
 local authority that tried to get you to stay? Yes. But John Taylor said we're going to give you an offer you can't refuse.
 Okay so that was quite hard to leave was it? It was quite hard to leave. You didn't say the name of this project at all.
 You didn't mention what it was called. Which project? The one you were talking about now. Where?
 In Ireland.
 In Ireland. It had a name which you didn't mention.
 Ringend. Ringend. Or Ringsend. But you successfully finished it. Oh yes. So Jero wherever you've gone
 you've left monuments. You've left really good, I mean it's amazing because if you believe in
 reincarnation when you come back you're going to sort of wander across the
 buildings in Prague and think... interesting I... you know that man who found Troy do you
 know he knew where it was that very very famous German man yes I know he landed
 Schiemann and he went to found Troy he knew where it was because he had been there
 he it wasn't the first time I mean sometimes you get those experiences where
 you think those people have been there there's a writer she's called Mary Renault
 and when she writes about Alexander the Great you absolutely know that she knew
 him she enters the world of a consciousness as if she's been there
 before it's kind of amazing so when you in your next life you will stumble across
 the







 the




































!
 different things and you'll think this is very familiar I've seen it very nice and you'll
 be able to do that all over the world because everything that you've built is very solid
 it lasts it doesn't ping like the bridge that's true I hope but anyway so so you finished
 the job I finished the job and so I I went to Istanbul so tell me why Istanbul is so
 beautiful and why Istanbul was something you couldn't refuse well somehow from history
 just the name and the vision of all the all the all the history yeah it just was driving
 or pulling me there yes yes and and quite rightly that that that that was really amazing
 place yeah and uh it was a very very beautiful place and it was a very very beautiful place
 it's it's really something which I'm grateful for that I finished my career in that place
 yeah how many years was it 15 11 11 that went far too so tell me about going to Istanbul
 how tell me how you felt and what you had to organize and well it was all very they
 were very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
 And so that was helpful.
 They spoke English?
 They spoke English.
 That was, you see, the project was partly financed
 by the World Bank.
 So this is when the money came.
 And this is why the Turks are able to afford it.
 Because, and, but the part I went,
 and it was the only one we actually got the commission for,
 was it included the very, very old Constantinople.
 When you look at the, you see,
 you can see it on the left-hand side.
 Yeah.
 There is this peninsula.
 It looks very small, but it catered for 2 million people.
 Right, right. Mm-hmm.
 So this is where I ...
 This is where I started,
 and it involved quite a lot of design work,
 which I did on the spot there.
 And was this once again a plant for processing wastewater?
 Yes.
 For the whole of Constantinople?
 First of all, collecting it, you know,
 so you need collectors, because before we started ...
 Just what can I do?
 Somebody pulls a chain, it's going to go straight into the ...
 Into the ...
 Sea.
 Sea without any treatment.
 And the same goes here, even worse.
 And so, for example, when I knew about this place from my studies in ...
 In the ...
 What?
 No.
 No, I'm getting so stupid.
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...

 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 In the ...
 and he was, I remember to this day,
 I was a gentleman.
 The Golden Horn, the most beautiful place on the Earth.
 You see there is the water and beautiful boats
 with beautiful ladies on with parasols
 and surrounded by palm trees and things like that.
 It's the most beautiful spot on Earth.
 When I go there, when I saw it,
 it was just an open sewer, most dreadful place.
 The water had become so polluted.
 Yes. The sea of the Golden Horn.
 The sea of the Golden Horn. Was sewage.
 Was sewage, yes.
 And that had been going on for how many hundreds of years,
 just pouring sewage into the water?
 Yes.
 Since the beginning of Constantinople.
 That's right. And that's why they called you.
 I mean, was it making people ill?
 Typhoid and things like that?
 Yes. All this was there, and so our task was to prevent this,
 so we built a system of tunnels on the coast
 parallel with the sea and parallel with the Golden Horn,
 and so all the wastewater from the town
 that I would say system, I mean tunnels,
 tunnels on the coast,
 and so all the water just goes into the tunnels,
 and then it follows the tunnels are built on a slope.
 Yes. Small slope.
 And eventually, it goes near the Bosphorus.
 Right. And at that point, we built a long ...
 Sea outfall.
 A long sea ...
 Outfall.
 Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.
 And the outfall consisted of twin pipes over 2 meters in diameter,
 so it has enormous capacity, and so this is how we designed it.
 So where did the waste go in the end?
 Into the sea after it was treated?
 After it had been treated.
 Oh, yeah.
 Before it's discharged with this pipe
 that we are talking about, there is a treatment plant,
 so it's treated. Cleaned, yeah.
 Cleaned, and so ...
 But this was actually the first commission we got,
 and it was meant for two years, and when we designed it
 and when we saw that they were somehow pleased with us,
 the Turks, so they said,
 Why don't you stay here a bit longer?
 And eventually from two years, they became 11,
 and which pleased me nowhere because ...
 Yeah.
 ... you know, that's ...
 And some of the pipes are really very, very, very long.
 And what happened about the sea?
 How did the sea get cleaned up?
 Was it just cleaning up?
 Was it cleaning itself
 because stuff wasn't going into it anymore?
 That's one thing, and the other thing is the sea contains
 a lot of oxygen, and the oxygen breaks up the dirty water.
 Yes.
 And this is how it cleans it.
 Cleans it. Mm-hmm.
 So is that sea now clean?
 The sea is clean.
 When I saw some pictures from Istanbul just the other day,
 fishermen whipping the water and catching fish.
 So, yeah, you've done amazing things in your life, haven't you?
 I mean, you've made such a difference to something.
 I feel so proud of you that you did that.
 I will have to go and look at that sea and think how you cleaned it.
 It's just amazing.
 The next time I go to Turkey, I will go there.
 Go there? Turkey, ignoring what I said, but Turkey,
 it's really a wonderful place.
 Yes.
 And there is so much to see there.
 Most of it, it's not really Turkish.
 It's either Roman or Greek.
 Yes. Or Armenian or whatever,
 but even the Turkish part, it's really wonderful place to be in,
 and we were so lucky.
 Although we spent 11 years, but we rented a house.
 Yeah.
 We rented a flat in the house, overlooking the Bosphorus.
 So you could, you just woke up in the morning, and there it was.
 And the Bosphorus is a river or a sea?
 It's a connection between two seas.
 Oh, yes.
 It's the North Sea, and down below, you get the Sea of Marmara.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 I see. Okay.
 And from the Sea of Marmara, it all goes down to the Adriens.
 Right.
 So let me just start again here, so that we don't get too much on one section.
 It was an enormous project.
 Enormous project.
 A value of about $1 billion.
 So it was really a big job.
 Mm-hmm.
 And it's...
 I wasn't the only one, the only person actually involved in this.
 There were other persons even before me.
 Working with John Taylor?
 No, there was some Dutch firm working on it.
 But we, John Taylor took it.
 It was actually, it was not only John Taylor, but it was a joint venture with Binnie's,
 Binnie and Partners.
 Oh, yes.
 So, but neither firm no longer exists.
 Oh, right.
 Because of various...
 Well, they've taken over by bigger things.
 Yes.
 Oh, right.
 So they've been...
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.

 Yeah.
 Yeah.

 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.

 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But the distances there and the town itself is so enormous.
 If I say that from one end of Istanbul to the Sea of Marmara, it's about 80 kilometers.
 So it gives you some idea about the scale of the undertaking.
 But as I said, it's so lively and there's so much to see there.
 And for eating, again, every evening you can go and the Turks are far more entertaining
 with the people.
 And the food is really most delicious.
 I mean, the Turkish, they can't be really compared with this.
 I don't know where the Turks came from, but came such a variety of food.
 But it's really...
 Is it a...
 Is it a...
 It's not a Muslim country, is it?
 Oh, it is.
 It hasn't...
 Hasn't it...
 Did Ataturk get rid of the Muslim religion?
 Well, he tried, but he didn't succeed.
 Oh, right.
 And now the Muslim, it's sort of filtering back.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 He...
 It's...
 It's weird.
 It's a place like the Istanbul.
 It's very cosmopolitan.
 You get...
 It's a...
 The Roman Catholics are there.
 There are churches and so on.
 Yes, yes.
 The Orthodox Greeks...
 Yes.
 It's...
 If I say that, you know, there is one church on the coast of the Bosphorus, for instance,
 where the patriarchs...
 Oh, yes.
 ...are.
 Oh, yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Then you have the Armenians, as I mentioned this, and then you've got, of course, the Muslims.
 And they are the strongest. And there are so many mosques everywhere you go.
 And every morning they all start singing, you see, at about four o'clock in the morning.
 Is it quite tolerant, though? Oh yes. It's a gentle kind of...
 It is tolerant. It's... I certainly got on with them very well.
 And some people, when I went there, they said they were impossible to work with.
 That was not my impression.
 What did they mean?
 Well, there was one man who said he was being observed when he was going to work,
 and how long he was at work, and that kind of thing.
 I never had this kind of impression.
 But at the same time, I...
 Well, the job was so enormous and so important, it might be, that it was well worth doing.
 And the job that you went on to do for the next years, was it the same job, just over a larger area?
 Yes, yes.
 Because initially it just covered the little peninsula you can see on the left-hand side at the bottom.
 But now it's spread all over.
 Oh, yeah.
 So you didn't...
 So you did that. You did all that. Golly, Yarrow.
 Well, it was well worth doing.
 You know, I don't think that people like you should retire.
 It's a waste, really.
 It is. You are quite right.
 I think it's ridiculous.
 I wish that you didn't have to retire. You could have carried on doing really interesting things.
 Did you retire because you wanted to, or...
 Or is it you have to legally, or...
 I'll tell you why I retired.
 Because just before I sort of decided on the retirement, the Turks somehow ran out of money.
 Oh, I see.
 And so I was sitting there doing nothing.
 And so I said, well, to help with this,
 if I can do it, it had nothing to do with engineering.
 It was just...
 And the World Bank, unfortunately, didn't sort of help me from this point of view.
 So that was a great pity.
 So how old were you when you retired?
 I was 60.
 65.
 Right. And you came here.
 And lived in the flat.
 I lived in that flat.
 But I mean, for a person like you to not have something valuable to do after a life like that,
 I mean, hasn't it been difficult?
 Well, it has, but I always found something to do.
 One was, for instance, I joined this choir,
 which was a wonderful choir,
 singing music which one doesn't sort of sing very often.
 And then they...
 Because everything has to be paid these days.
 You need money for this.
 So they made me the treasurer.
 And so I was really busy doing this treasurer's job.
 And...
 So that's all I can say.
 And they themselves, you know, when they were out of money and they knew I was going,
 they even made...
 made a huge farewell party and...
 But they never said, why don't you stay with...
 And we'll find the money.
 We might find the money because...
 Was that in Istanbul?
 Yes.
 It was a great pity.
 But they would have wanted you to stay even longer if they had wanted to stay.
 If they had the money, I would have probably stayed.
 You would be there now.
 I would be there now.
 And we would come and visit you.
 We would be in love.
 That was a wonderful place, even for visits.
 And the flat we had was not very big.
 Yeah.
 But the views.
 Yeah.
 You see, looking down, you see the new bridge there.
 And you can see the whole Bosphorus up and down.
 And when you...
 Did you tell me once that you used to have to fill the bath with water in the morning?
 Oh, yes.
 Well, that was another...
 There was a lack of water.
 Was that every single day?
 Well, when...
 Just when we retired.
 Well, that was another thing which sort of contributed to my decision because there was
 no...
 There was no water.
 They didn't...
 They just ran out of time.
 Yeah.
 They ran out of time.
 Just ran out of water.
 So how on earth did people survive?
 Well...
 I mean, did that go on for years, that there was no water?
 That was going on for...
 Maybe it's going on even today.
 So you needed...
 They needed you to stay to sort that out as well.
 So you used to fill the bath with water in the morning and then use it for washing and
 cooking and...
 Just think, there were 19 families in that house and when the water came on, everybody
 was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody was...
 Everybody wanted to wash their hair and have a bath and so on.
 So within the next ten minutes, the water vanished again.
 So how did you have a bath and things like that?
 With difficulties.
 Or not at all?
 Did you go to the Turkish bath?
 Well, you could do, but you're in the Turkish bath.
 They ran out of water too.
 They ran out of water too.
 But did you live without water only at the end?
 Only in the end.
 The last year or something?
 They imported water from the other side of the Bosphorus for a period.
 For instance, hotels couldn't afford to be without water.
 So under a hotel, there were two lorries every evening pumping water
 so that the visitors...
 The lorries could wash their hands.
 And hospitals as well.
 So they...
 But it was really very, very difficult.
 But this was nothing new because there is a system of dams
 on the left-hand side which was built by the Ottomans.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 And even in those days, it's comparatively smaller
 when you look at it now.
 But even that, they were short of water.
 Yes, yes.
 And so when you left 11 years later, you were 65.
 You came to Edinburgh and Aunt Margaret died.
 Yes.
 And that's how I got to know you again
 because Agnes knew that I was living in Aberdeen.
 Yes.
 And she ran my father.
 We visited you in Aberdeen.
 No, but first you ran my father.
 Yes.
 And he said to me, you have to ring Agnes.
 She wants to tell you when Aunt Margaret's funeral is.
 Yes.
 And so I came down and went to Aunt Margaret's funeral.
 And then we started to meet regularly, actually.
 We've been meeting regularly ever since then.
 Yes.
 And that was a year of what?
 I don't know.
 Well, Yara was 65 when he retired.
 When were you 65?
 I don't know.
 It doesn't matter.
 It doesn't matter to you.
 We can write it down.
 He's still .
 But I just missed you living in Constantinople.
 I just missed going to visit you in Constantinople.
 I had known.
 Yes, you could have done that.
 You then.
 I would have loved that.
 Even Manta and her husband came and .
 Yes, we did.
 It became very popular, the place.
 We had so many visitors.
 Toby and Alice.
 And Robin came to visit you?
 Oh, yes, she came.
 Yes.
 And Uncle James.
 He was our regular.
 Yes, yes.
 A regular.
 And the children came?
 The children came.
 Did Aunt Bonder come?
 No.
 No, she said she had enough travels.
 Mm.
 She didn't want to go anywhere.
 But we, with Uncle James, we made so many trips.
 Well, Gallipoli, for instance.
 Yeah.
 Gallipoli.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 So we took him there.
 Yeah.
 And he really enjoyed this.
 And.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 He was a great friend.
 Hector was the first child. And then... Adma. Was it?
 I can't do it off by heart.
 But if Hector was the oldest, do you happen to know whether there was a lost child at the beginning?
 Well, I told you that there was a Roberta missing.
 But was she right at the beginning? Do you know?
 Because Hector was not a first child in the way he behaved.
 He behaved like a second child, running off and going to be a car mechanic in Australia and marrying a girl from the outback.
 I mean, he did not behave like a... A first child is normally responsible and tradition.
 And he was the exact opposite. I wonder if there was a child lost before him and he was actually a second child.
 Well, there was also something with the second child.
 The Second World War ended. The father, he was sent to Isle of Man.
 Oh, was he? He was interned. Yeah. And all the people who started Camp Hill, where I worked, they were all on the Isle of Man.
 Really?
 So they would have all been on the Isle of Man at the same time.
 And why were they there?
 Because they were Jewish-German. They were Viennese.
 But they were not considered...
 They were enemy aliens, even though they had fled for their lives.
 So was my great-grandfather on the Isle of Man for a long, long time, or for the whole war?
 For the whole war.
 Yeah. Well, did he ever talk about it? Do you know?
 No, he didn't talk about anything.
 Because my people who I knew, they turned it into a university.
 They didn't just suffer. They turned it into a sort of cultural...
 Opportunity.
 But when you look at the children, how they were born one after the other, most of them were born before the war.
 Yes.
 And suddenly there is a gap of four years.
 Yes.
 And then Miriam came.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 1918.
 I was always told that I was like Miriam, but I never met her. People would say to me when they met me, they'd say,
 Oh, you're just like Aunt Miriam. But I never knew her, so I didn't know.
 She was very...
 As I would say, vivacious.
 Oh, maybe.
 She married a Pilkington.
 Right. So we're not talking about your life now. We have to be careful.
 So I just want to make a gap because I want to ask you something.
 Get it?
 So, Yarrow, you had a very, very long and meaningful life.
 And out of all of this long life, where everywhere you've been, you've left something changed and transformed in some way.
 You've also had lots of relationships and lots of family.
 And what do you feel is important that you would like to tell your children for the future?
 From my point of view, the most important thing is to see what one left behind.
 In his life.
 And something which is well worth thinking of.
 And something which is useful to everyone.
 And obviously there are many more things one can do, including our children and so on.
 I'm thinking that perhaps I could have spent more time with John.
 John, Ludie and Ines.
 Her and Peggy, pardon me.
 Yes.
 And that I could have spent more time with them.
 Leading them to something.
 But I'm not quite sure whether this is really required.
 What makes you think that?
 Do you feel that you didn't spend enough time with them?
 Well, what is enough?
 I'm just thinking that sometimes I could have spent more time with them.
 And for instance, even now, we have, suddenly we don't see our John at all.
 Does he not come in the summer?
 Well, he comes for, so we're regular.
 And then, it really bothers me.
 And so I'm just wondering whether I've done something wrong.
 So, which sort of guides him away from me.
 I don't think so.
 So, Jaro, could I just ask you, have you ever considered writing and asking him that?
 No, I don't think that would be really helpful.
 Why not?
 Well, I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Because I've got an amazing life philosophy.
 Shall I just turn this off?
 Yes.
 Or can I talk into the tape?
 Because I think it's a conversation about your life.
 Can I carry on with the tape on?
 Yes, you can carry on.
 Okay.
 Because I've discovered that one of my greatest new steps in my life is that if I'm worried
 about something, I actually go and ask him.
 And I always discover that it's completely different from what I'm worrying about.
 And I'm always so glad that I've asked.
 But I think, I can't give you advice because you are your own person.
 But I think you might discover that it had absolutely nothing to do with anything that
 you have done.
 No, I don't think so.
 It could be to do with the pressure of life.
 Could be.
 Because John is very successful in his career, isn't he?
 Yes, he is.
 And so they just...
 I mean, Tom doesn't have one single second of his life.
 I mean, it's just ridiculous.
 And when men are in the middle of their work and John isn't married, he doesn't have children,
 and so he gives all his life to his work.
 So I think it would be...
 You know, it's really important to ask things.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 And I think it's a very important thing.
 and John isn't married, he doesn't have children,
 and so he gives all his life to his work.
 So I think it would be, you know, it's really important to ask things.
 I wanted to make sure that there was nothing that I had left unasked
 before I lost people who I loved,
 or, you know, I wanted to make sure that we had talked about everything we needed to talk about.
 And it has always worked for the good if I've done that.
 And how beautiful for John if you just wrote him a letter and asked.
 What makes you think it wouldn't be helpful, if I may ask?
 I think it may put him off.
 Oh, no, he would be touched.
 I bet you, I bet you 50 quid.
 She's putting her...
 I bet you 50 quid, if you please, would be right back.
 Or phone immediately, or...
 I mean, you can't lose, can you? He's out of touch.
 He's always okay when he speaks to Yara,
 or when Yara rings up, or when I ring up, and so on.
 He's always as if he just stopped talking a minute ago.
 Right.

 Right.
 There's nothing...
 Right.
 There's nothing...
 There's no gap in there.
 It's work.
 It's really...
 It always says that he has to prepare.
 I've turned it on.
 And you tell us what you're going to talk about.
 When I was retired,
 so the first thing we had to do is to vacate our flat in Istanbul.
 And so...
 But before we eventually left Istanbul altogether,
 I decided to organize a meeting or farewell party
 for my employers, employees of the people who were from the mean.
 Ah, yes, yes.
 And so this is...
 This is...
 This is what happened.
 But before it happened, we were...
 So we were...
 But we would have to...
 Agnes and I would have to stay somewhere overnight,
 at least one night.
 And there was one hotel which we had in our eyes for some years.
 And the hotel is called Pera Palace.
 And that's...
 That's the place where all...
 The famous visitors and travelers stayed when they came from...
 On the Orient Express, including Agatha Christie.
 Oh, yes.
 And then...
 And the name of it was?
 Pera Palace.
 Pera.
 Pera.
 P-E-R-A.
 What does that mean, Pera?
 I do not understand the subject of Turkish.
 Ah, yes.
 Palace.
 And so that's what we did.
 You...
 I don't know who in each room had a...
 Notice.
 Here, Agatha Christie stayed.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 Somewhere else was...
 Shah...
 Shah...
 So...
 So...
 So...
 Stayed.
 And then...
 And I...
 I think Agnes has got the phone in the kitchen, hasn't she?
 Do you want me to run and get it?
 No, I can take it here.
 I'll turn it off.
 You're on.
 So, I booked a room in this Pera Palace hotel.
 And then I booked another room in a hotel which is called Four Seasons, which is in the main street of...
 Very famous hotel.
 Very famous hotel.
 And invited all the, you know, the maids and so on.
 And we had a...
 We had a good dinner all together and people came and then...
 And eventually we said goodbye.
 And Agnes and I went back to this hotel where we had the room booked.
 And that was the...
 Literally the last time I saw...
 I ever saw them because then it's...
 You know, the people, they stayed.
 They stayed.
 They stayed.
 And the other thing, of course, was that somebody had to replace me.
 So, there was a man who worked in Cairo.
 And so, he was actually nominated as my replacement.
 And he...
 So, he came and I hand him over all the papers and things like that.
 But...
 And then we set off.
 I mean, we went to...
 First of all, to the Hotel Pera Palace.
 We stayed there overnight.
 And the following door, the following morning, we set off.
 I just can't describe the feelings.
 You know, if after 11 years you suddenly know that's your last journey from that place.
 So, it was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 It was very...
 I would not say emotional, but it was very, very difficult.
 Was it like a sort of bereavement?
 Yes.
 Like a bereavement?
 Yes.
 But I knew this area very well, so we set off.
 We went off, we went for the Greek frontier, and we got there, all right, and on the other
 side of the frontier there is a little town called Kavala, and in this, it was in the
 evening already, so long distance and everything.
 So we went to a hotel in Kavala.
 Beautiful.
 And we stayed there overnight, and the following day we went from Kavala to a Greek place called
 Meteora.
 Have you ever had that?
 No.
 Well, if you ever go there, it's really well-known.
 We know one day we must ask you to write us a journey from the Kavala.
 A journey?
 Because Tom would love to do a journey in Turkey, but he needs advice from someone like
 you who could explain.
 Well, but this is already, I mean, in Greece, and so as I've said, from Kavala, the following,
 it was a beautiful night, and of course suddenly you are in a different world because you have
 all the worries, all the anxiety or whatever, the responsibility.
 It's just suddenly gone, it's very strange feeling.
 Anyway, we just continued, and we were aiming for, in the past we would go to Athens, but
 we just thought, well, perhaps, we've been there so many times, so instead of Athens,
 we went to a place called Meteora.
 And Meteora, it's a place with various deep hills.
 And on each hill is a monastery.
 Oh, wow.
 And the monks, in order to get there, they would have a ridge and a basket and somebody,
 of course, had to be up there, and there was some brave man who managed to do, it was like
 in a mountain, you know, to climb there.
 Mm-hmm.
 And he would drop this basket down and whoever went to get there, he would just pop in.
 And they had a winch at the top, and so they winch him up.
 Mm-hmm.
 And we didn't know this, of course, but I'm just describing how hard it was.
 It was in the early, when they built all this, which is several centuries back, but now they,
 you know, it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
 and it was really quite involved to get up there.
 But once you were up there,
 it was a typical Greek scenery.
 You know, the monasteries were decorated with the Christ
 and, you know, the typical sort of views.
 So we had a lot, we knew that anyway,
 that was not our first, and we liked it so much,
 so we decided to go back.
 And so eventually we descended down,
 and there was a hotel, very simple.
 And we stayed overnight there,
 and the following morning,
 we went towards the Greek coast.
 And our aim was to hire a boat and to go to Italy,
 to Bali, B-A-D-L-I.
 And that's exactly what we did.
 Somebody else was sailing the boat, though.
 Oh, it was an old ferry.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 It wasn't very old.
 It was a proper ferry.
 And it took the whole night just to cross.
 When you look at the map, it's very short,
 but it took the whole night to do.
 Yeah, mm-hmm.
 Anyway, the following morning we got there,
 we had breakfast, and
 then we continued across the mainland, Italian,
 through various old, rarely visited villages,
 through old people, and it was very interesting
 to see how the people lived there and then so on.
 And eventually we arrived,
 what is it called?
 It's so stupid.
 It's not Amalfi, but beside Amalfi.
 You know when I say Amalfi,
 it's the Italian coast facing south.
 Oh, I know, it's beautiful, very famous, wonderful.
 Very, very famous.
 I know what you mean.
 And there are several, one of them was Amalfi,
 which was Uncle James' favorite.
 Yeah.
 But we didn't go to that one.
 Beside it, there is another hotel called,
 Amalfi.
 Amalfi.
 Amalfi.
 I don't know the name.
 Porto Silla or, anyway.
 And this is, you know, very steep hill,
 and on the hill there was a kind of alleyway.
 And there were various stops, and each stop was a room.
 A room.
 Oh, how amazing.
 So you had to know which room you want.
 Yes.
 And then you stopped in that Porto Silla, Porto.
 No, it's not called Porto Silla.
 But that kind of.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, and so we stayed there one night.
 The next night, we said we must go and see where Uncle James went to Amalfi.
 So we went and visited Amalfi and stayed overnight there as well.
 And then the following night, we left.
 The following day, really.
 We left and we went all the way towards Pompeii.
 Oh, yeah.
 And, I can't remember the time, which we wanted to see after Pompeii.
 The series?
 Vesuvius.
 Vesuvius.
 This is the mountains, yeah.
 You can see.
 But we saw this Vesuvius, of course, but we also saw Pompeii.
 It's such a large place, so we spent nearly the whole day there.
 So when we left, it was already evening or dark, so we didn't get really very far.
 So we stayed overnight somewhere, but I can't just remember the name.
 And next day, we headed for Rome.
 And in Rome, we stayed in one place which was recommended by some friend of ours from Istanbul.
 And we spent several days in Rome, visiting St. Peter's, of course, and various other
 old places.
 And we stayed there for a few days.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 And then we went to Rome.
 days in in Rome visiting St. Peter's of course and various other old churches.
 Positano it's called. Oh yes yes. Positano. That's the hotel. That's the hotel we stayed
 the beginning of Positano. And it was so nice.
 Yes it was. But then we stayed in Rome and we spent several days there visiting St. Peter's.
 Sorry. Go on.
 And then well there are so many so many famous churches and cathedrals.
 And so we visited all these. And then so I can't remember how many days we actually spent there.
 And in the end we decided that was enough. So we continued towards Florence.
 Florence. And we parked our car in Florence when there were people there.









 and we had a look around.
 Had you been to Florence before?
 Yes, we had.
 But it's always something new to see.
 I know, it's wonderful.
 Wonderful place.
 And so we had a look and then have a look around and so on.
 And so we stayed, I can't remember, it was one night or two nights,
 and then we continued towards the north and we stopped at Pisa, I think it was, and Siena.
 And then we went to Assisi.
 Oh, Assisi is a beautiful town.
 And well, that was really wonderful.
 And after Assisi,
 again, that's where we stayed overnight, you see.
 And then so we had so much time, no rush and so on.
 So we took advantage of this.
 And then we continued towards the north, aiming right towards Venice.
 But on the way we stopped somewhere else again.
 And eventually we got to Venice.
 And we stopped there.
 And then we had a look around and we spent several days there.
 And the other thing is, you see, I worked so hard, I would say,
 that I had so many holidays and I was never able to take any holidays.
 So this, and all this was being paid.
 Oh, how marvelous!
 So I got about three months of paid leave.
 How marvelous.
 Wonderful.
 That was, eventually we got to Venice.
 And so we had a car and we parked the car.
 You know how it is, parking is not easy.
 But so we saw Venice all the way around, left and right.
 And it was very good.
 And then from Venice we would go towards Padua.
 We had a look at Padua.
 And then from Padua we would go towards, what was the name of that Italian big northern city?
 Milan?
 Milan.
 Yeah, the good color of Milan.
 But what we couldn't see is the Last Supper, you see.
 Oh, yeah.
 Clouds.
 We've been there several times, but never that place was open.
 Oh, I've had the same problem.
 So we never, never, never saw this.
 But after this, from Milan, off we went across the Alps.
 And there was...
 Well, Alps are Alps.
 I like that.
 And then we stopped at Barbara's.
 See, that was in Switzerland.
 So we stopped there for a day or two, I can't remember how long we stayed in with Barbara
 and Tommy.
 And then from there, we took it to Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 Bohemia.
 So you could go and stay without being frightened of being put into prison for nine months?
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 That was all over.
 Otherwise, I wouldn't have been there.
 But so we went to Bohemia, and it was in the summer,
 so we had swims in the rivers
 and a good time with all the friends and relatives
 and so on, so that was lovely,
 and then it was time to go back,
 and I still remember for the first time,
 we visited Helen in her German town.
 Is that the place where I visited her?
 Yes, where I visited. She was living there?
 Yeah. And did she have the baby by then?
 Not yet. Not yet?
 Yeah. They weren't married yet, were they?
 No.
 So we stopped there, and we had a chat,
 and I remember sleeping, and then there was some hotel,
 little hotel, and ...
 Mr. Pachulik.
 Mr. Pachulik was the proprietor,
 and Pachulik means a little boy.
 It's all in ...
 In Czech. In Czech.
 But he was German. He was German.
 Uh-huh. The whole thing was German.
 It was our first visit. Oh, yeah.
 And I couldn't believe my eyes.
 We just drove in, and the main street was called Sudetenstrasse,
 and there was Dvorakstrasse, Smetana Strasse,
 and that kind of thing.
 Anyway, we had a good time, and then, of course,
 it was time to go home, so from there, I think, we just ...
 We just took it across the rest of Germany and Italy,
 and then we went to Bohemia.
 Again?
 No, no, no. Sorry.
 You went from Germany to France to the ferry.
 The ferry, yes, and home.
 Yeah.
 And on the other side of the ferry, we went to ...











 On the other side of the ferry, it was woody, I think.
 But it was such a long, when I think of it now.
 Was it three months? Did you take three months to do that journey?
 Just a few months.
 Oh good, how marvellous. What a wonderful way to come home.
 But really there was no pressure to rush somewhere, you see.
 And there was also no worry about money because it was paid leave.
 That's right.
 So that makes everything perfect.
 And then Ludi met you at the ferry?
 Ludi met us at the ferry and we went to her house and then we stayed overnight in London in her house.
 Was she still married then?
 She was.
 1994 we came back. All this was happening in 1994.
 I know that.
 But we are wondering what state of, what position Ludi was.
 When did she get married? I don't remember these things.
 That's not the question. When she was married, but when she was divorced.
 Never mind.
 But they must have been so pleased to have you home.
 Yes. Yes, they were so pleased we were going home.
 And so were we. We were at home as lost.
 And when you got, had somebody been looking after your flat?
 Because Aunt Robin had died, so...
 She died, so it was...
 Empty.
 It was empty.
 But there was nobody who was going in and...
 No. And it was still up there, you see.
 Yes.
 And no, we had no problems and then nobody even showed any interest of our children.
 They would say we would stay there during our holidays.
 Oh, yes. Because I remember meeting you just after you got back.
 And you saying, well I decided to paint one room and then one thing led to the other and we ended up having to paint everything.
 And you got completely, completely overrun with workmen painting everything and sorting out all the different practical things.
 And you'd started off with one little job, but it expanded into the whole house.
 Yes, yes. Because if you do that, the rest of it was so much...
 Terrible shabby.
 Yes.
 Empty. So that's what we did.
 And then the next day, we were resting for a while and then somehow it was the beginning of September already.
 And there was a concert in...
 In one of the local churches here.
 And so we went there and there were friends of mine, you know, I used to sing with them years back.
 And including Paul, Paul, Paul, Stuart Paulie.
 And he said, why don't you join us? We need, we need a bass.
 And that was it, you see.
 And then I... So that was 1970, 1994.
 And Kim was there, my boyfriend Kim, who I was his lodger. Rosemary and Kim.
 Yes, yes. Oh, Kim was there definitely.
 Rosemary wasn't, was she? It was just Kim.
 Rosemary as well.
 Was Rosemary in the choir?
 Yes, she was in the choir.
 Oh, I never took that in. Oh, yes, yes.
 Yes, she was in there. And Kim was... So he was a big animal.
 He was the treasurer, wasn't he?
 Well, he... No, he was the president.
 Oh, wow.
 He was the president.
 Anyway, so I... I joined them.
 And I... You see, I had so much...
 This choir, that was even before I went abroad.
 I sang with them.
 Oh, yes.
 And we had... I had the opportunity to sing.
 Sing music, which is so difficult to get.
 Like for instance, Misa Solidnitsa.
 And the German Requiem.
 And I just remember these three.
 But I'm sure there were more than... more than this.
 And so I'm really grateful to them for all this.
 But then with the choir, they somehow liked what I was doing, you see.
 So they say, why don't you...
 Why don't you join us and become our treasurer?
 So of course that's what happened.
 Weren't they glad to find you?
 How could I say no?
 So I became a treasurer until... until the end, really.
 And...
 Has the choir stopped now?
 Sorry?
 Has the choir stopped?
 No, no.
 They are different.
 So what did you mean until the end?
 Until my end.
 Oh, I see.
 Until you stopped going.
 Yes, when I stopped going.
 So...
 That was rather sad.
 You know, the departure, to United Rebellion.
 They gave me such a farewell.
 I have never experienced anything like it.
 Yeah, why did you stop going?
 Because... because my voice...
 Your voice changed.
 My voice changed and I just couldn't sing what I used to sing.
 Oh, I see, I see.
 Otherwise I would have stayed there.
 But they were marvellous pieces of...
 of music, German, French.
 English and Scottish or whatever.
 That was...
 When we listened to the Radio 3 every day in the morning,
 so often they play something exactly that Jaro says,
 oh, I sang this, I sang that.
 Very often.
 Yes, that was a really good opportunity for having a good time, if you like.
 Some of them were really...
 very difficult.
 But if it comes off, you know, the music,
 there's some beautiful, beautiful pieces of music.
 And so...
 And did you perform in public?
 Yes, that was all in the Usher Hall.
 Oh, wow.
 Somewhere very good.
 Yeah, yes.
 Usher Hall was...
 the messiah for Christmas.
 It was always in the Usher Hall.
 And then at one stage Usher Hall was being repaired.
 So I had to sort of negotiate a different venue.
 One of them was the Festival Theatre,
 which was marvellous.
 Wonderful.
 Yes.
 Very spacious.
 So it was really very enjoyable.
 So I can't really complain of being bored or...
 So when you retired, you had things to do where you never felt bored.
 That's right.
 I mean, I mean, with the treasurer.
 You see, my computer was red hot.
 Because I had selling tickets, buying tickets, ordering tickets.
 And so there was so much to do.
 Oh, yes.
 It was incredible.
 Oh, there were soloists.
 You know, some of the soloists were...
 I don't know where from.
 And so you had to really deal with them
 and write to them.
 Yes.
 And...
 No, it was so much to do.
 It was something entirely different than, you know, what I used to do before.
 And this is why it was so interesting.
 I found it very interesting.
 But mainly, I learned, you know, to do music.
 For instance, the Misa Solomones, Beethoven.
 This is such a terrific piece of music
 that you can never forget.
 And so I was really grateful to the organizers,
 to the owners, to the choir, really.
 So...
 And that was probably my song,
 because then I couldn't sing, so it was the use.
 But you did in the past,
 but you did another amazing thing,
 because you did the translating for the prisoners.
 Oh, yes.
 How did you...
 So after...
 Did you start that after the choir had finished?
 No, that was sort of coinciding.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 That went together.
 How did you get involved with that?
 Well, it was surely accidentally.
 Accidentally.
 Somebody...
 I don't know who actually advised me.
 And he said,
 where are you from?
 And so I said...
 And that person said,
 they just need a Czech interpreter.
 And so I said, how do I...
 And they said, just go and talk to the...
 to the choir manager.
 So I did.
 Next day, I was already going somewhere.
 To Dundee or whatever.
 Yeah.
 So, no, that one said...
 Sometimes, some of these was very sad, I must say.
 He said it's not really fun, but...
 Some of the prisoners were sad, in sad situations.
 Yes.
 And would you be asked to go and sit in a prison interview room,
 a police interview room, while they interviewed a prisoner?
 And then you would hear very sad stories.
 Yes.
 But they are...
 Most of them are very skilled liars.
 They don't...
 So you never know what to believe, you see.
 Oh, yes.
 And...
 But that was not my task, to discover whether he was lying or not.
 But just to interpret.
 Just to interpret.
 But thanks to this activity, I got to know the whole Scotland.
 Not only Edinburgh or Glasgow, but all over the world.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland.
 I got to know the whole Scotland. Not only Edinburgh or Glasgow or whatever. I got absolutely everywhere.
 You wouldn't believe which small, even small place. They have the Sheriff Courts, for instance, in Wernesp, or...
 Livingston.
 Livingston, very popular Livingston. With this prison.
 So that again, just first of all, what I appreciated, that one view is being needed.
 Oh yes, exactly.
 And I had nearly every day,
 I had to do something.
 Sometimes it was at 2 o'clock in the morning, of course.
 Sometimes that was a bit boring.
 A sort of emergency, that you had to come.
 Yes, and one of the most, I wouldn't say interesting, but suddenly they phoned me and they asked me to go.
 And then Agnes as well, she told me, because there was some lady giving...
 giving birth.
 So it was the first time in my life, with three beings, with three children, assisting during the delivery.
 And there was this poor woman yelling there, head off.
 In a hospital?
 Yes.
 In a hospital?
 And Agnes was there?
 Yes, it was marvellous.
 And you, why were you both there? If you...
 Well, I just went with him.
 She was just, she just went there to support me.
 So did you hold the lady's hand or...?
 No, no, no, no. They were very good to her.
 She had nurses and for the first time in my life, I heard the child's heart beating.
 They had all the machinery and the consolation and everything.
 The nurses were very good to her.
 She was Slovak and she lives in Glasgow, is it? Was it in Glasgow? No, Livingston.
 Livingston.
 And did you see that baby born?
 No, I didn't.
 Of course, I saw everything. I saw the baby coming out and I saw the nurse waiting with her arms and then she grabbed him.
 And what kind of baby was it?
 It was a little boy.
 And was he called Yarrow?
 It wasn't.
 Aww.
 But I said to myself, here I am with three children, never got the opportunity to see that kind of thing.
 And suddenly...
 And you didn't find it too overwhelming?
 No. Not with my age.
 You were sort of used to this kind of thing. There was almost nothing that could shock you.
 That's right.
 Because I think young men have been known to faint.
 Oh, I can understand.
 I mean, a lot of midwives say it's better if they're not there because they faint.
 But no, I didn't faint. I...
 The main word we had to repeat was push.
 Push.
 Push in Czech.
 And did poor woman, she had nobody to support her from her own family or anything?
 No, that was her husband.
 But he couldn't speak English either?
 He couldn't speak English. He was watching apples.
 Apple, that's how I remember.
 He was what?
 Eating an apple.
 Oh dear.
 But did he also look excited and happy?
 Oh yes, very much.
 Yes, later on.
 But don't we live in an amazing country that provides those kinds of services? It's really wonderful.
 Yes, it is.
 But this was really the whole night of her.
 Because she just couldn't produce.
 And then we were all shouting, push, push.
 And she wouldn't.
 And nothing would happen, you see.
 She wouldn't because it hurt too much.
 I don't know.
 I believe it's not a very pleasant experience.
 And we were the second ones.
 Before us there was a lady there already 12 hours or how many hours.
 And we were the second group to look after her translation.
 Ah yes.
 So she's been taking a long time.
 Poor thing, poor thing.
 It was her first baby.
 It was her first baby.
 They're hard work, aren't they, my third.
 Yes.
 So Jaro, I think we need to have a little break to make sure the machine doesn't over...
 Yes, I was just thinking that was our biggest experience with...
 So Jaro, in this session, maybe you could tell us a bit what kind of advice you would give to people.
 What kind of advice you would give to people, especially to your children.
 Well, my advice would be to be patient with people.
 And respond to any questions you get from anybody.
 And make sure that whatever you are saying,
 it's of kind use and help.
 And what makes you say that?
 Why do you feel that's so important?
 Well, I think that kind of help, it's useful to anybody.
 Do you think it's something that you learned from your work?
 Yes, of course.
 It's...
 I mean, during the work, one has to see the reaction of the...
 of all the others.
 And if there is any sign that the other person doesn't understand,
 or...
 So I would always try to help them.
 Clarify it.
 Yes.
 And also you showed great patience with all the Turkish colleagues and so on.
 Yes.
 With language and translating and explaining and driving them about and so on.
 That falls into the same category, doesn't it?
 Did you...
 I feel as if you were very sweet to your children.
 Well, I had some tremendous time with my children.
 All of them.
 And I had a very nice marriage.
 I had very nice memories of, you know, what we did.
 And it doesn't really apply to my children, but also to my grandchildren.
 And so...
 At least they like coming to visit us, which pleases me very much.
 And...
 Excuse me.
 So...
 No.
 I think...
 We are grateful to have them.
 In the amount of place in our park, yeah.
 I had with all of us, for instance, playing football.
 Yes.
 And with the girls as well, of course.
 And so...
 And then they enjoyed it and...
 Or swimming in the spring pool.
 Or golf.
 Or golf.
 Can you play golf, Jero?
 Well, not very well.
 But Robert can.
 Robert, of course, he beat me left-right.
 So...
 When I first met you, when you came back, you and Jackie and Robert and the girls and Agnes,
 you took us to a town outside Edinburgh, where you go...
 On a boat to look at the birds on an island.
 Oh, yes.
 Passerog.
 Yes.
 It's called Passerog.
 And somehow or another, we lost each other.
 So we arrived there before you, and we had to jump in the boat.
 And we went whizzing around this rock, and we came back.
 And my picture of you is a kind of symbolic thing, because you were standing on the shore.
 And in your eyes, you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 And you were standing on the shore.
 arm was everybody's coat. And you'd come with everybody's coat. It's a picture of love.
 It's a picture of love. That with every single person's coat, you were waiting because you
 thought we would all be cold. And I thought, what a lovely daddy. You must have been such
 a wonderful dad. And the water was very wild on that day. It was very, we had a great time,
 I must say. But nowadays, they've never let anybody do that because of health and safety.
 I mean, we were just piled into this boat. And I remember how when the boat went up,
 all the children did, ah. And when you went down and it went, ah. There were two big sounds
 with all the... It was lovely. I thought it was great. But Yaro, is there anything that
 you really wish you could say?
 That you could still do?
 I don't think of anything just this minute. But I may remember something. So if I do remember
 something...
 You'll write it down.
 I'll write it down and I'll send it to...
 Well, no, we'll have other times if you like to...
 Oh, that's even better.
 We'll, we'll, we don't have to do it, but we'll make other spaces for this to be possible.
 But at the moment, I think we've covered. Thank you very much for watching.

 Thank you very much.
 And I hope that you will continue to do this.
 Thank you very much.
 And I hope that you will continue to do this.
 Thank you very much.
 And I hope that you will continue to do this.

 good triumphs and evil is destroyed by itself.
 That's right.
 Usually.
 But that was not always with the Czech fairy tales, they always have good ending and good
 advice.
 And this is why I thought it would be very useful for the children to remember this rather
 than...
 Modern Disney stories.
 Modern Disney stories.
 Did you hear Czech fairy tales or did you hear Grimm's fairy tales?
 Czech fairy tales.
 So are there fairy tales from Czechoslovakia that I would have heard of that became known
 in the whole world?
 I don't know.
 Not that I agree.
 There are many, many...
 There was one hero which was a bit short.
 Short of a dozen.
 Short of a dozen.
 A penny short of a dozen.
 Yes.
 But he is always the hero of these Czech fairy tales.
 Is he a kind of fool?
 Yes.
 A kind of simple fool?
 Simple fool.
 That's right.
 But a good one.
 Yes.
 Like Christ is a simple fool.
 Yes.
 Often.
 So that's...
 That's what I would have heard.
 Yes.
 That's what I would have heard.
 Yes.
 That's what I would have heard.
 Yes.
 That's what I would have heard.
 That's why I thought it would be useful for the children to remember this.
 Yes.
 Rather than listening to some... on the television or anywhere where it says people are killing
 each other and they have...
 Yes.
 And were you ever able... did you tell your children Czech fairy tales?
 To begin with.
 I'm sure.
 Yes.
 I was reading them some Czech.
 But later on they didn't understand.
 There was no point.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I think that's what I would have heard.
 Yes.
 Yes.

 member of the church? Yes. Do you remember your experience of when you knew that you
 believed in God? Well, that was automatically. You just always believed in God? Yes. And
 you never doubted it? No. So that's amazing, isn't it? That's quite unusual. That's what
 happened to me. And do you find that a sort of important comfort in your life? Yes. Can
 you tell me a bit about what it means for you to believe in God? Well, it gives me some
 assurance that my life is leading somewhere.

 Yes.
 Yes.


 Yes.
 Yes. I understand. Yeah. That's all I can say. Yeah. That it has meaning. That it has
 meaning, yes. And Jaron, just like they do in Desert Island Discs, do you have a favorite
 book? I keep changing them and there are various... No, I don't. I wouldn't say that I have one
 favorite book. I have a favorite book. I have a favorite book. I have a favorite book.
 I have a favorite book. I have a favorite book. I have a favorite book. I have a favorite

 Currently I am reading a book about the Battle of Waterloo.
 And it's very well written, which I thought.
 And it just shows you what was happening and how it was happening.
 And we were there, we saw it.
 Was the Battle of Waterloo on land? Not on sea?
 On land.
 Oh, where was it? Where?
 Near Brussels.
 Oh, right.
 North of Brussels.
 Okay.
 There is a little village called Waterloo.
 Oh, gosh, I'm so ignorant. I'm sorry.
 Never mind. But this is where it all happened.
 And once we went on holidays with the children and so on.
 And we went on holidays with the children and so on.
 With our car.
 It goes back many, many, many years.
 Yeah.
 And when returning.
 So I thought it should be not only for me, but for them as well.
 Just to see the, what it actually all happened.
 And so we did go.
 To my amazement, you see, like anywhere else these days,
 there are souvenir shops.
 Yes.
 And so there are many souvenir shops.
 And most of the beasts and so forth, this is not Wellington or anything.
 It's always Napoleon.
 Oh.
 As if Napoleon had won.
 Yes, yes.
 If you didn't know your history, I'm not kidding.
 But isn't that surprising?
 I wouldn't have thought they would like Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 I think they would have liked Napoleon in Waterloo.
 Yes, yes.
 If you didn't know your history, they are not killing.
 But isn't that surprising? I wouldn't have thought they would like Napoleon in Waterloo.
 Because they wouldn't have liked being invaded either, would they?
 No, but still they... this is how it is. I don't know who...
 And there is a little hill in that area with the centre of the fighting.
 And at the top there is a lion. And who do you think this lion represents?
 Napoleon! Of course.
 So basically, I think you've always been very, very interested in history.
 Yes. I think you're reading history.
 Yeah.
 History books, because I think they are interesting to read.
 Yeah. And do you have a favourite piece of music?
 Oh, I have many, many favourite pieces of music. Very, very.
 I don't think I would... any good music you can give me.
 But it's Beethoven or Mozart or Mahler or the last Mahler symphony I actually sang here in one of the churches.
 here in one of the churches was Symphony No. 2 called Resurrection.
 Do you know it?
 Yeah.
 So I don't need to sing much more.
 Is that the particular favourite do you feel?
 Well, it's because I sang it.
 Ah yes, you know it better.
 I know it better.
 And when I, in addition it was performed here in this church, what is it called this church?
 Not St Giles?
 No, the one with the dog.
 You know where the dog is buried?
 Oh dear, I'm sorry, I don't know Edinburgh well enough.
 But it doesn't matter because everyone will know.
 It doesn't really matter.
 I can't think of the name. I'm hopeless at remembering things.
 The music is quite loud in some places.
 And just to hear it.
 But it's loud in a good sense.
 So that would be one of my favorites.
 This resurrection.
 I like Máðr.
 One of the reasons is because he is my...
 He comes from the same country I come from.
 He's Czech.
 And here...
 Do you have a favorite film?
 Favorite film?
 I've got many favorite films.
 I like films...
 What's the name of this?
 By...
 Hitchcock.
 Hitchcock, for instance.
 Or by the Pink Panther.
 Ah, the one... Tom's favorite film.
 Peter Sellers.
 You want to make Tom happy, you would let him watch the Pink Panther.
 He cries with laughter.
 And if you were to go on a desert island and you were allowed one luxury, what would it be?
 It would be some of the second symphony by Mahler.
 To have music.
 Mm-hmm.
 Wonderful.
 Máðr.
 Wonderful.
 Wonderful.
 Wonderful.
 Wonderful.
 Máðr.
 Music is the last thing that my mother enjoyed.
 She couldn't understand films.
 Made no sense to her.
 But music she could listen and appreciate to the very end.
 Even, as I say, when her...
 When she became confused.
 ...mind wasn't so good.
 What about you?
 Or what did you find most interesting?
 Or what is your favorite piece of music?
 Shall I... I'm going to end... I don't want to be on your tape.
 Okay.
 But I can tell you...
 Oh, sorry, I forgot. This is still running.
 We can stop now. Okay.
 So, Jero, which is your favorite place?
 My favorite place, it's called Drahov.
 D-R-A-H-O-V.
 And it's located in South Bohemia.
 Yeah.
 And this is where my mother came from, where she was born.
 And this is where the farm, which...
 Where the whole family originated from, which is located.
 And it's...
 Excuse me.
 I had most wonderful times in this village and in the fields around.
 And so I just have the best memories one can imagine.
 That was your... When we first started speaking, we began there.
 That was describing that time there.
 Did we?
 Yes, you told me...
 You were telling me your life story, and then you described how...
 You went to that village and all the different things that you did there.
 So the first two or three tapes are all about that time in that village.
 Oh, I shouldn't have started.
 So you didn't... No, no, it's wonderful, because it's wonderful to end with that.
 But the family is still there, aren't they?
 It is.
 Are they still in that farmhouse and...
 Yes.
 That little house that your parents lived in, is that still there?
 Yes.
 So every...
 Well, my mother...
 My mother is dead, of course.
 Yes.
 And my grandfather and grandmother, they are all dead.
 But my cousins...
 Yeah.
 My cousin and her...
 And their children, they are still living there.
 And you go and visit...
 You often used to go and visit there.
 Well, every time I go there, so I always go to visit there.
 And you take Helen sometimes and...
 Yes.
 Other members of the family.
 Well, they love going to Draug.
 They love this very much.
 And I love it.
 I love it.
 I love it.
 I love it.
 I love it.
 I love it.

 I love it.
 I love it.
 but now it's, you know, so many years back.
 Does he sometimes visit there with you?
 No.
 Since he was a grown-up, has he visited there?
 No.
 Do you think that when the children hear the Czech language spoken,
 do they have any memories?
 No.
 I'm surprised.
 I think John may be a single word.
 They would understand what they are.
 Otherwise they don't.
 Amazing.
 So shall we stop there?
 We stop there.
 Well, thank you very much.
 Thank you very much for you.
 No problem, Yara.
 Hello.
 Hello, my darling.
 Yes, that was an important thing.
 And it was a big success.
 I'm surprised because you thought,
 oh, they'll delete my document that I passed my examination.
 It's very big, so...

 me to... So how are you feeling? Can we carry on?
 Yes.
 Okay. Ready?
 Ready.
 So you had to do an exam?
 Well, I'm coming to it.
 But first of all, when the year... So as I said, I got the permission and the whole family and so on to stay in England one year.
 And then after one year we had to go to back, going back, which we did.
 And I even went to Victoria Station to get train tickets because the regime, the communist regime didn't allow us to fly.
 So we had to go by train.
 And so first of all I had to go to Wooloo and pack all the equipment and, you know, shoes and clothing and so on.
 And we were ready to go.
 And we had to spend one night there because the train went...
 And anyway, which we did.
 And the following day when I was on the day, supposedly, of the day of departure,
 I was in the train.
 And I was on the train from London to Prague.
 Are you with me?
 Are you still with me?
 Yes, absolutely.
 So we were getting ready to go to Victoria Station and take train and then from train to stand and so on.
 And it took...
 The train journey took about 36 hours.
 It took very long.
 Anyway.
 But when I woke up and I said I buy myself last English newspapers.
 So I got the book.
 And there it was that Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Warsaw Pact forces.
 And I'm sure you heard this.
 Because they felt that the regime was too liberal.
 And so they were coming in to put the boot down.
 Yes.
 And so what actually did happen was that I didn't know what to do.
 You see, there I was.
 The day before that I had a big celebration with the firm.
 Telling them goodbye and things like that.
 And they gave me a power trip pen and that kind of thing.
 And in Wüller of course with Anka James.
 So we were going home.
 And suddenly this kind of news appeared in the newspapers.
 And because as you know the newspapers you don't know what to believe sometimes.
 So I decided to go to Kensington Gardens where is the Czechoslovakian embassy.
 And so we went there.
 All of us.
 And...
 And I asked you know what is happening.
 And they said, oh it was such a pandemonium.
 You just can't imagine in that office.
 And they basically told us if you don't go anywhere, at least you absolutely have to.
 Because the frontiers are closed.
 The buses don't run.
 The trains are not running or anything.
 And you may get trapped somewhere.
 Stranded somewhere in Germany.
 So if you haven't anywhere to stay, stay there.
 And this is how it all started you see.
 We went...
 So I went back to the same firm.
 There was still the drawing board which I didn't quite complete.
 It was still there.
 And so they said, you can finish this off maybe.
 And then we rented.
 Because we still weren't quite sure what was what.
 So we rented temporarily a flat for the children.
 And Agnes.
 And...
 So and how the whole thing actually started.
 Then we of course when...
 Being a civil engineer.
 We got more and more involved in design work and project and calculations and so on.
 And the more difficult it is to leave all this.
 And so I just asked for my road to Prague.
 To my, you know, the Prague employer.
 And I explained the situation.
 And I asked them if I could stay and ask for another year.
 And they gave me one year you see.
 And that was already...
 The situation was entirely different.
 You see you got the Dukček there and...
 Was Dukček very right winged or...
 Yes.
 So he was coming down on everybody much stronger.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 But they still gave you another year?
 They still gave me another year.
 I'm amazed.
 So I tried my luck.
 I thought they said...
 They gave me one year.
 And so I got the permission from Prague.
 And so I went back to John Taylor's again.
 And they said you just continue with your work.
 Were they welcoming?
 Were they pleased?
 Yes.
 Wonderful.
 They were very pleased.
 And by then you could speak English.
 And then you could speak English a bit.
 A bit like more than before.
 And so I stayed there one year.
 And this was, as I've said, you know with civil engineering once you stay somewhere
 longer.
 You get involved.
 You get involved and it's difficult to leave.
 And this is what happened with me.
 I got jobs, marvelous jobs to do in...
 On Isle of Wight and...
 And I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 I got a job in...
 all these jobs in the line of white and other neurons.
 And so when that year, the next year expired,
 I wrote them and dealt for another year.
 Did the checks, you see, which was a bit cheeky.
 But could I just check before you go on?
 You'd left behind a house and a mother-in-law,
 and was there somebody looking after the house
 and all your possessions?
 My parents.
 Oh, so you felt as if everything was being cared for.
 It wasn't like it was all just exposed.
 It was safe.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 My parents were looking after this.
 But then I...
 So you asked for a third year.
 Yes, but before that, my mother died.
 Oh, dear.
 So I...
 Was that very unexpected?
 Yes.
 Did she have a heart attack?
 She had...
 Varicose veins.
 Varicose veins.
 She was actually in London visiting us
 about a month before that.
 Oh, right, so you'd had a chance to see her.
 So we saw her.
 With her sister.
 With her sister.
 But then when she returned,
 somehow she had to go...
 She had these varicose veins in her legs,
 and so she went to hospital in Prague.
 And during this operation, suddenly she died.
 And so that was a bit of a shock.
 How old was she?
 What?
 56.
 She was young!
 No, she was very young.
 Same as my mummy.
 My mum died at 56.
 That was the same thing?
 Oh my goodness!
 Oh dear, oh dear.
 That's a very big shock.
 That was a big shock.
 And so that's how it all happened.
 And then after I got the permifet, the extension another year, so then I asked for another one,
 you see.
 Of course, they didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't...
 They didn't agree, the Czechs didn't agree and they said you must come back straight away.
 But by that time I saw the children were getting so well here in this country, they lost the Czech completely.
 And I was very happy in my work. And so I just wrote to them and said that I was not coming back.
 But Jarro, what was it like for you to leave your country? Was it a trauma?
 Well, it wasn't. Because the way it happened.











 way it happened. It was gradual. It was gradual. And also there were such positive things happening.
 That's right. That you felt that it was something beautiful to do this new thing. That's right.
 Not be under the communist regime. Yes. That's right. And so I decided, but maybe it was
 for the children, you see, because Johnny Boy and they were already in George Watson's here and studying very well.
 And were you living in Edinburgh by then? Yes. In the house that I know? Yes. In that flat down the road there?
 Yes. It was 1970, I think. So...
 So this is a...
 Yes.
 How it all happened.
 But did it mean that your family got into any trouble because you had done that? They did.
 What happened to them?
 Well, they were during my absence. There was a court case against me.
 And when my father was invited as a witness, my sister was there.
 But nothing happened to them except...
 They gave me nine months imprisonment.
 If you came back?
 If I came back.
 If they could get hold of you?
 Yes.
 And did they take away all your property?
 Yes.
 So your father couldn't save anything? He couldn't get anything out of the house that was precious to you?
 Well, whatever they...
 They managed to save, even against his mother.
 They managed to save something. And what you see here actually was taken from out of our house.
 Oh, good, good. Okay.
 So...
 But...
 But you lost the property that you owned, your house and...
 That's right.
 And was it easy to get a visa to stay here? I mean, was it difficult for you to say, I want to become a British?
 Well, I had to apply for citizenship.
 So did you apply for that after you told the people you weren't coming home?
 Yes.
 So that was a risk. You burned your boat, didn't you?
 Yes, yes.
 It's...
 The law said that at that time I would have to stay in this country at least five years.
 And then I can apply.
 And so that's what I did. I waited until five years.
 And then I wrote and applied.
 And two chaps came.
 Two chaps came to ask and to investigate what was hot.
 And so we had a nice chat with them.
 And then some lawyer came into my office.
 And I had to swear to the Queen.
 And I got a British citizenship.
 Oh, did you?
 And so was Agnes already a British?
 Yes.
 And she was a British citizen because you had a...
 Yes, she was.
 A dual...
 You had dual nationality.
 Yeah.
 And it was clear that you were not a burden to the state.
 Yes, that's right.
 Right.
 Okay.
 So by the time you finally became a British citizen, what year was that?
 Can you remember?
 That must have been 1970.
 Oh, yes.
 That must have been 1970.
 Oh, yes.
 Oh, yes.
 Oh, yes.

 it was possible to visit him. So he saw our children, you know, the girls went to see him and see this, this, her and that's my father.
 Ah, wonderful. She's so clever, isn't she? Amazing.
 So where would you like to go from here? Because you've now got British citizenship.
 You're living in that lovely house in Thurlston Road, was it? Yes.
 And you, the kids are at school. And so what was your next great step in life? What happened then that was important?
 Well, I should say that I worked in Edinburgh here.
 On a sort of permanent basis. I left John Taylor's.
 Oh, yes. And I joined the corporation, they called it Edinburgh Corporation.
 And we built, when you see this beautifully clean estuary, this is part of my job as well.
 Wonderful. Anyway, and so,
 well, that's what I did.














 Well, that was had to be finished like anything else. So when it was finished I was wondering
 what to do and John Taylor, you know the previous employer, they came to me and they said look we've
 got this job in Abu Dhabi, would you like to join us? So... Is Abu Dhabi the place which has got that
 very famous huge hotel? No, this is Dubai. Oh yes, right. Abu Dhabi is it an oil state?
 Well Abu Dhabi and Dubai and there are five actually emirates and they drank it.
 And Abu Dhabi is the biggest. Oh I see. And richest. Oh good.
 They have the most of the oil.
 But they don't have the oil.

 But they don't have the oil.
 They are not so clever with money and so on like the like the shirk in Dubai.
 And this is why you don't hear so much from Abu Dhabi. Oh yes.
 Anyway so... What did they want you to do there? Well they were building treatment plant for Abu Dhabi.
 Okay. And you can see when you go to our kitchen you can see part of it
 part of the plant which I was responsible for. And so I went there for three years
 which was really some wonderful experience. So where did you live? Did you have your own flat or?
 Yes, you know the firm, it's a different world you see. They gave me a car, they gave me a flat and so I was okay.
 And what was the, who were the people, I mean who did you spend your time with? Were there lots of English people or?
 Yes, there were quite a number of, I mean the whole firm, John Taylor and Sons, was there.
 Did you live all next door to each other on an estate or?
 Not necessarily, it just depends how the flats became available.
 Oh I see.
 And so I got, I changed it twice didn't I, or three times.
 Anyway.
 So I got, to begin with I got a flat, two bedroom flat, which was very good and comfortable and there are so many places to eat.
 So you know the life was.
 You didn't eat at home, you went out?
 I went out.
 And what sort of things did you eat for breakfast in Abu Dhabi?
 Oh, cornflakes.
 Oh just normal European food.
 Just normal, everything what you get here, you go there and more.
 And so there were shops just for foreigners or for everyone?
 For everyone.
 Oh yes, okay.
 You could get, you could get absolutely anything there.
 And was it a place where you're not allowed to drink?
 Yes.
 So, so.
 But.
 Yeah.
 But.
 The foreigners like myself.
 Oh.
 The foreigners like myself.
 They get a piece of paper and according to this piece of paper you can buy certain, whatever, whatever.
 Because there's the best, the nicest shop in the whole of Abu Dhabi was the one selling liquor.
 Oh.
 So Europeans were allowed to drink?
 Yes.
 So you didn't have to do that in secret or?
 Well you have, you were not allowed to drink it in the open.
 Oh really?
 You had to bring it home from the shop.
 Oh yes, yes, yes.
 And were there clubs where you could drink?
 Clubs and hotels.
 Yeah.
 So, so you, you were allowed.
 But I, I, I, I don't really, don't give it too much.
 And, and, but.
 I remember one year you brought a bottle of vodka.
 Yes.
 And you had to drink it.
 Yes.
 And you had to drink it.
 Yes.
 And you had to drink it.
 Yes.
 And you had to drink it.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And you brought a bottle of whiskey, Scottish whiskey back here.
 But, so were you away from the family then?
 I was away from the family.
 Which wasn't so good.
 And how, how much of the year did you, were you away?
 Three years.
 So you, they didn't see you for three years?
 Oh they did.
 They could, you know there was a provision for holidays and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
 way? Three years. So they didn't see you for three years? Oh they did. They could, you know, there was a provision for holidays and so they could visit Abu Dhabi for Easter and Christmas. For Christmas I always went home. So I was here. So did you all go to Abu Dhabi? Yes.
 But I always went for a few days or something, not for a long time.
 Oh yes. Whatever the Easter, I got free flight tickets for the family. John came, Ludy came, Ines was too small so she didn't come.
 Agnes came and so so. Helen came. Helen came, yes. So there was always somebody on the way.
 And Jero, did you feel lonely without your family? Of course. You must have been worried. My father was always away as well. In Brunei and Nepal and Africa.
 I think it used to make my mother lonely. She found it difficult to go.
 I think it used to make my mother lonely. She found it difficult to go.
 I think it used to make my mother lonely. She found it difficult to go.





 She found it difficult that he wasn't there.
 Yes, that was the problem,
 and even the other problem was the heat, the weather.
 Yes, 50 degrees Celsius.
 The weather was fortunately,
 what was actually fortunate was that the timing.
 You see, we had such a stiff time to finish the job.
 Yes.
 So there was no free time.
 You could just get on with it and not sit
 and think about being lonely or hot.
 Yes.
 You just got on with it.
 Did you have air conditioning and things like that?
 Oh, yes. I got air conditioning everywhere,
 air conditioning in the car, air conditioning in my flat,
 air conditioning in my office.
 And did you like your colleagues?
 Yes. They were all right.
 They were all right, yes.
 And did you get to know anything about the culture?
 No. The culture, you see,
 there are very few people sort of local.
 I know there are these sheiks and so on,
 but they are usually cocooned in some ...
 Yes, completely different sort of life.
 Different life.
 And are the ordinary people very poor?
 They are usually very poor, yes.
 And so could you see big contrasts?
 Between the sheiks and the poor people, yes.
 And very happy.
 The sheiks, they were really clever enough to keep them quiet.
 They gave them pretty sort of hefty handouts.
 So the poor people were not really so poor.
 They got help if they were ill.
 But they liked it. They were really Bedouins.
 Oh yes, yes, really. So they were allowed to travel?
 Yes, they were allowed to move.
 So it was a Bedouin culture?
 Yes.
 But then there were modern cities?
 More modern cities.
 And what was the industry? There was oil.
 Oil, that's all. The rest was all imported.
 And is this the place where lots and lots of people come from India to work?
 Yes, that's what I was thinking.
 There were many Indians.
 And the Balmuchis?
 No, they are not Indians.
 And Balmuchis.
 I don't know whether they are from Bal. Where are they from?
 They come from somewhere from Pakistan.
 Oh, I see. Okay. So now I think we have to just download again.
 They did all the gardening in the street.
 Swattering the trees.
 So everything was really carefully looked after?
 Yes.
 And looked nice and you felt safe and all those things?
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 Yes.
 And then we went to the market.
 It's unbelievable, it's five minutes to four o'clock.
 I feel sort of one o'clock.
 So what do you think about a drink?
 Good idea.
 Would you like a cup of tea?
 Coffee.
 I think, do you have something like fizzy water?
 Or even herb tea actually?
 You can have herb tea.
 I've never been able to drink English tea.
 Agnes, can I help you?
 No, I'll bring your tea.
 Can I, I'll come and, can I get you anything now?
 I'll have a cup of coffee.
 A cup of coffee.
 I'll bring this along for Agnes.
 Let me take this, Agnes.
 You have a think, Yaro.
 Delve into your memory.
 I'll be right back.

 able to get out in your i give him very many offers and he always says no so i'll stop giving
 him offers well because if you go outside you have to be uh master of your movements oh yes
 well i am offering to take your chair and go you just can't do this
 how can't i do it of course i can do it when you go to the hospital are they going to collect you
 in an ambulance no he takes a taxi oh we never asked actually and they used to they used to
 send an ambulance or something and i'm sure if i if i asked
 them i like what we do again but we you can get taxi and then get really reduction on taxi
 and so because it's going to the hospital yes
 so from the transport point of view i'm all right i don't
 know what to do you know i always thought of edinburgh as the greatest city in britain
 so i'm very disappointed how they've treated you in the national health
 well not enough doctors and too many patients
 i i i i don't know but it is it is really disappointing the whole year
 and you couldn't really get hold of anyone could you that was what was so awful
 even
 today for instance i was expecting some notification
 about the next visit to the hospital which is on the fifth which is on the fifth yeah
 it's quite soon
 i just heard about the hospital and i was like oh my god i'm going to be in hospital for the next five years









 I just hope and pray that they make the 18th absolutely definite.
 So do I.
 Because it's awful how you'll have to ring up to see if you really do have the place
 that day.
 Well we'll see but it's not very good.
 It does surprise me because in the past I never had this kind of problem.
 Well you never went to hospital.
 Well you did, you had the rat poison thing.
 Oh.

 Do you remember when you had to take rat poison?
 I still have it.
 That was a big thing wasn't it?
 Yes.
 But this rat poisoning thing, I don't have any problem with that.
 It's sort of automatic and it's all organised by the local GP and they come once a week
 or whatever is actually needed.
 The only thing which I still don't know is what it is.
 Oh.
 I don't know.

 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.

 is why they can't do the analysis of the blood themselves here.
 Because there are these, it used to be quite simple.
 Why they have to send it to the hospital on the other side of the town?
 Because the machine that analyzes it is expensive,
 and they can't afford it at our local GP.
 We were told.
 That's what we were told.
 But I don't think really.
 Anyway.
 But Jero, did you have the rat poison because you had an embolism?
 No.
 I had something with a cold, irregular heartbeat.
 Mm-hmm.
 And so they decided to do something about it.
 And...
 Basically, that's the reason why I basically be given this rat poison for everything these days.
 To thin the blood, I thought.
 Mm-hmm.
 But that means that the doctor who will operate on you will have to know.
 Oh, he does.
 When they phoned me the other day about this,
 they said we didn't know about it.
 Oh.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.





 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 And they said, well, we have to do something about it.
 and we will have to do something before that.
 Yeah, otherwise it's not good for bleeding.
 That's all right.
 But they can do everything now, so...
 So that should be okay.
 Mainly they have to get around to it.
 So have you had some coffee?
 Yes, I've had some coffee.
 So we're in Abu Dhabi.
 We are in Abu Dhabi.
 So do you feel ready to go on?
 Yes, I am.
 Okay.
 So there you are in Abu Dhabi.
 Did you say you were there for three or five years?
 Three.
 Three, okay.
 So Yara's just going to start speaking about Abu Dhabi.
 I spent three years in Abu Dhabi.

 actually nearly drinking water quality.
 Whereas sometimes we never go as far as that because it costs money.
 The whole scheme was very interesting from that point of view.
 The wastewater had to be pumped from Abu Dhabi all the way up the hill, which is called Mafraq.
 And at Mafraq the wastewater is treated and aerated and all sorts of things.
 And in the end the clean water is being discharged, returned back to Abu Dhabi.
 And in Abu Dhabi it's used for...
 irrigation purposes.
 So when you go to Abu Dhabi today, you will see a very green part of the town.
 Because that water is being used for irrigating palm trees and grass and so forth.
 So that's...
 Otherwise it's nothing special about it.
 The only thing I would like to say is that the climate is very harsh.
 And I have noticed that some people were not able to bear the heat.
 And some people, I remember a colleague of mine, he came and he went over the following day because he just...
 Couldn't face it.
 He couldn't face it.
 Otherwise it's a very pleasant place.
 Very rich, of course.
 And is it always that hot? It doesn't have seasons.
 Well, it is much cooler in winter.
 In November and January and that kind of...
 It's much cooler.
 But it is very hot.
 It gets very hot already in, say, April.
 And it just continues.
 And we had, for instance, there was a lot of concrete mixing involved in our construction.
 And for this you need really the right conditions because otherwise the setting of the concrete could be much faster than you need because of the hot weather.
 And the only thing is, what one has to watch is that hot climate.
 It's also very humid.
 And it attacks all the reinforcement steel bars.
 Oh yes.
 And they rust.
 I saw some walls or some construction where the steel rust actually tore the concrete apart.
 So this is another thing.
 Otherwise it's very pleasant.
 And Abu Dhabi initially was a town of pearl hunters.
 Oh yes.
 Oh, women.
 Diving into the water.
 Diving into the water, putting pegs on the... and looking for pearls.
 It was done by women.
 All women.
 I'm not so sure about that.
 I am.
 But you didn't mention the difficult conditions that the workmen, when they worked on the...
 on the project, how they had to suffer heat.
 Yes.
 On that treatment plant worked about a thousand South Koreans.
 And they came just for one year.
 Isn't it amazing?
 Yes.
 But they would last only one year.
 And after a year a new thousand came.
 Yeah.
 And they went home.
 And they were really very, very hard working people.
 And sometimes one has to really pity them.
 Because the conditions were really so bad.
 They weren't given proper air-conditioned...
 They... well, you can't if you are working on the site outside.
 Oh yes.
 There is no... maybe in their huts.
 They had air-conditioning.
 But actually working on the site, you can't... you can't provide this kind of facility.
 What language did they speak?
 Korean?
 Korean.
 So did they have somebody interpreting for you?
 And they... had they any skills or did they learn...
 Oh yes.
 They were extremely hard people.
 Builders.
 Hard working people.
 And they had the skill.
 They could do anything.
 Ah, yes.
 The only thing which they couldn't do was plastering.
 Oh yes.
 And rendering.
 So for this there were some places because part of the scheme or the plant were also
 buildings.
 Kitchen and laboratories and things like that.
 So for this we had people from Pakistan.
 They were very, very good at that.
 And was it all men?
 They were all men.
 No women.
 So what did they do?
 Because they must have wanted to meet women and have some kind of comfort and warmth.
 They had to postpone it till they went home.
 There was no question of... they just stayed there and worked?
 They stayed there and worked.
 They didn't know... it's really very tough and difficult.
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 They had to...
 difficult difficult job and the regime of work was function that we work 13
 days out of 14 so we had 13 consecutive days hard work then one day off was that
 some different calendar or just because you had to get on you had to get on it
 was to do with getting everything moving but that's a long time without break
 isn't it that's if you are there you do what the shake says yes and the shake
 pays the money okay and so the shake said I want to have this done in two
 years time and that actually governs the schedule so we had they have it really
 very good
 the money supply and the money flow and I had to go and visit the client at least
 once a month yeah and to show them how much money we need and the client was
 not the sheik the client in the top client was a shake but you spoke to a
 manager and they were also they did they were people from Pakistan and Sudan it
 was one from Sudan and Pakistan and Pakistan and Sudan and Pakistan and

 once he visited my site or the building site and so I was showing him around and so on.
 Then I gave him, it was so hot, so I took him to my office and gave him a cup of tea and suddenly he said, asked me if I would allow him to use the telephone.
 So I said of course, he was the client and he was, so he lifted the telephone.
 I couldn't believe my ears, there was this most beautiful Polish coming out of his mouth.
 Polish? Polish. Sudanese.
 He was a Sudanese and the Sudanese sent many, you know, to Warsaw and so on to study civil engineering.
 Wow.
 Even to Czech Republic.
 And so he, he married some Polish girl.
 Oh.
 That was so, so.
 And that was before the fall of communism.
 It was the fall, yes. That was 1970, before the fall of communism.
 Yeah, and you were allowed to marry a Sudanese man if you were behind the Iron Curtain.
 Well, anyway, there she was.
 And I was even, we got rather friendly and he, so he invited me to his house.
 So I went to his house and whom do I see is the terribly blonde wife.
 Of the terribly black man.
 Terribly black man who was sitting in the corner and smoking hubbly-bubbly.
 Yes.
 And, and one.
 Mother-in-law was there.
 I went there.
 Say it.
 Anyway, so, so that, that, that was very strange.
 But they were quite nice people, you know, this.
 Mm-hmm.
 His.
 They spoke English.
 Oh, perfect.
 Mm-hmm.
 Perfect.
 And did they have children?
 Oh, yes.
 Beautiful children.
 Chocolate brown.
 Oh.
 Not that brown.
 Not.
 Not that brown.
 Not that brown.
 Not that brown.
 Not that brown.
 Not a light blonde.
 Curly hair.
 Curly hair.
 That's right.
 Curly hair and, and admiring the father who was smoking hubbly-bubbly in the corner.
 But the hubbly-bubbly wasn't marijuana?
 I don't know what it was, but not, not really.
 No.
 It must just be an, an, an, an Arab way of smoking tobacco.
 Yes.
 They have it normally.
 Yeah.
 So, Yaro, that project got completed.
 That project got completed.
 Yes.
 I don't know what it was, but not really.
 It must just be an Arab way of smoking tobacco.
 Yes, no money.
 So, Yaro, that project got completed.
 That project got completed, and so they...
 Did you have a big party?
 We had a big party.
 And, of course, everything continues.
 I could have stayed there for another...
 But the three years was just about enough.
 Yeah.
 So...
 Did you meet the sheik at the party?
 No, they wouldn't come there.
 You didn't have a sort of opening,
 and the sheik come and give you a hawk and ask you...
 No, no, he didn't give me...
 I got no hawk.
 No lovely racehorse?
 But it was a good place for parties,
 which I don't really like very much.
 And the expatriates, they have forever party.
 Yes, yes, I remember that from Africa.
 And so, after this, I went to Dublin.
 Now, hold on.
 This is quite extraordinary.
 So, you're living in Abu Dhabi,
 the hottest, driest place in the world,
 and was it John Taylor again?
 It was still John Taylor.
 John Taylor and a Taylorian.
 They said to you...
 They said, would you...
 There is a job on effort in Dublin.
 Would you like to go there?
 Oh.
 So I said yes.
 The most beautiful country in the world.
 That's right.
 And so I went to Dublin,
 and again we had to rent a...
 This time Agnes went with me.
 Were the kids all gone by then?
 They were all gone.
 And so she was...
 Agnes was with us.
 And also my mother-in-law visited us
 for some longer stretches.
 And so that was very nice.
 And I like Ireland.
 I liked very much.
 How long were you there?
 Again, about three years.
 And you rented accommodation?
 I rented accommodation.
 Because you had this flat here.
 Yes.
 And did Aunt Robin live in that flat?
 Yes.
 And so you always knew that was safe,
 and that the kids had somewhere to go.
 But how had Aunt Robin got to England by then,
 Scotland by then?
 Oh.
 What happened there?
 I took her to Scotland.
 That happened several years before that.
 What made her decide to leave Czechoslovakia?
 Because of us.
 She wanted to be near you.
 She wanted to be with the grandchildren.
 And so that was really...
 I tell you all that.
 She...
 At that time it was somehow possible
 to communicate by telephone.
 So I phoned her.
 And we agreed that we would meet,
 that she would go at a certain date
 and a certain time.
 And that she would arrive at the Czech
 or the German frontier
 at a certain date, at a certain time.
 In her car.
 And I would wait for her
 and take her here.
 You mean she was fleeing or she was allowed to come?
 She was allowed to come.
 So was she allowed to bring her possessions?
 Yes.
 Oh, good.
 Mm-hmm.
 Why was she allowed to come?
 Because she had English relations.
 Yes.
 And they let her bring her money
 and her possessions
 and to sell her flat.
 And so she didn't have to lose everything to come.
 That's right.
 Oh, I'm so glad.
 And so I...
 I was based in the United Borough,
 you know, in our flat.
 And one day I took a train
 to London.
 And the whole night,
 night train, I can't sleep at night.
 And then in London,
 I hopped on another train
 and went to Dover.
 And from Dover, I went to Ostend.
 And from Ostend, I went to Mainz.
 And from Mainz,
 then I went to the Czech frontier.
 It was the plan.
 Oh, yes?
 It was just before Christmas.
 Therefore, pitch dark everywhere.
 And eventually, I got there,
 to the frontier,
 absolutely half dead
 because of not sleeping.
 Yeah.
 And so...
 then I came to the frontier.
 And...
 asking when...
 You know, when it was Mrs. Samson.
 They said,
 not yet, but we'll ask.
 But it's amazing the amount of communication
 between those two sides.
 Mm-hmm.
 Anyway, they said,
 oh, she's not...
 she's not ready yet.
 So have a cup of coffee.
 So I said,
 and a cup of coffee.
 And that was about 1 o'clock.
 Agreed that we would meet at 1 o'clock.
 In the day?
 In a day.
 Mm-hmm.
 And the train,
 which then continues to the Czech Republic,
 but I couldn't.
 I had to leave the train
 at the railway station.
 So I sat down and had one coffee.
 And after one hour or two, I had the second coffee.
 Then I had another coffee.
 And then I had another coffee.
 And then suddenly,
 a fast car arrived.
 And that was a taxi driver.
 And he just returned from the Czech part.
 And said,
 there is a woman on the other side.
 And the place is full of violin.
 Violins.
 Violins.
 That was our grandpa.
 And so there was nothing I could do about it.
 But he went there with his wife,
 the taxi driver.
 And the plot was that he would actually bring grandma in there
 because she couldn't drive.
 She had a car,
 but she was unable to drive it.
 Oh dear.
 And a friend took her to the frontier,
 a Czech friend.
 Some Czech took her to the frontier.
 And then she was on her own.
 On the other side, it was me.
 But just no man's land.
 She needed someone to take care of her.
 And this is when this taxi driver came into it, you see.
 What's that like?
 So eventually, it was about seven o'clock.
 They appeared.
 Grandma was absolute.
 The state she was in,
 that was terrible.
 And she was in a very bad state.
 That was terrible.
 Because they had, you know, the Czech guards.
 They gave her really a bad...
 Really?
 They threw everything out of the car,
 onto the ground.
 Any bit of paper they collected and checked.
 And if there was our name on it,
 they confiscated it.
 Well, she was really legal.
 You see, they had no right to do this.
 Yes, yes.
 But this is how they treated her.
 And she was in no state to argue.
 But anyway, suddenly she appeared.
 And you see the Czechs,
 they not only confiscated her or whatever,
 but also they stole her number plate.
 Number plate.
 So she arrived, and the car was completely naked.
 So I...
 So I thought to myself, I said,
 well, you can't drive across Germany
 just like that without number plates.
 And so I went to the German office.
 It was on the German side of the road.
 I went to the German office, and I said,
 look, and I explained the problem.
 And he said...
 He said...
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And he said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And he said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And he said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And he said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And he said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And he said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 And I said, look, I'm going to the German side.
 the ferry booked in in Osten. So we were driving and grandma slowly cooling down and eventually we
 apart from one incident in Belgium where I couldn't get petrol
 and it was about five or six o'clock in the morning the ferry was to go at seven
 and you probably heard you got there you got there an hour you've got an hour in hand oh yes we got there
 but I had to make a detour you see that I was on the motorway and the motorway takes you straight
 to to Osten but because I had no petrol I suddenly realized I wouldn't get there because there was no
 amount of petrol.
 So I made a DVD to...
 There is a little town.
 Near to Ostend?
 Near to Ostend.
 I don't remember enough about...
 You don't remember the name?
 I do remember, but I can't remember his name.
 Never mind, we'll add it later.
 So you stopped and got petrol.
 So we stopped and got petrol and got, just in time we got to...
 Got onto the ferry.
 Got onto the ferry and as soon as I sat down in the ferry, I fell asleep.
 Because I hadn't had sleep for several nights.
 Oh dear.
 Because of trains and...
 Because of the train?
 Trains not being comfortable and you can't sleep on them.
 I can't sleep on the train.
 Anyway, so...
 And the journey took about four hours.
 So we got to Dover.
 And from Dover, I drove to London.
 And in London we stayed overnight in some kind of digs.
 And so we stayed there overnight.
 And one day, because we were rather tired from it, so was grandma.
 So the next day we went to Leicester Square.
 And they had most beautiful steak, which grandma liked.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.
 Grandma liked it.

 Grandma liked it.
 a little rest. You're making
 me think of having a little rest.
 I'm sorry.
 No, it's alright.
 I'm sorry to bore you.
 No, no, you're not boring me.
 That's the terrible thing if you think that.
 27th April.
 This is session 7, I think.
 7 sessions.
 Very nice.
 Saving, saving, saving.
 Good.
 You know it's pouring, we're saying.
 Oh, it's
 almost looks like
 more than rain.
 So a new file.
 Now if I try and have a rest now,
 I'll completely feel awake.
 So I think what we should do
 is just have a little chat.
 Because I think it's the
 concentration of listening.
 The concentration of listening
 and keeping it all together
 makes me suddenly get all sleepy.
 Let's talk about something silly.
 Tell me a joke, Yaron.
 A joke?
 Yaron,
 that's no jokes.
 You might need jokes
 today.
 I know one joke in German.
 A mouse
 sees
 a bat.
 And he says
 I'm Engel.
 Do you get it?
 A mouse
 sees a bat. A bat is a mouse with wings.
 And the mouse says
 Look, an angel.
 Not good.
 I haven't managed to make you laugh
 with that one.
 It's very serious.
 It was a great achievement
 in my life when I could actually tell a joke
 in German.
 But Tom says that I'm really bad
 at telling jokes.
 Yaron, I need you to absolutely
 understand I'm not bored.
 Well, it's
 maybe too long.
 No, it's not. It's not. It's absolutely not.
 It's because
 if you concentrate,
 you need little breaks
 and just sort of shut your eyes.
 It's not too long.
 We're doing very well, I think.
 Seven. Seven departments.
 I think what you have to understand,
 is that I'm actually really fascinated
 by people's lives.
 I don't think of it as
 boring. I think of it as
 kind of amazingly interesting.
 So, please don't think that, Yaron,
 because it spoils everything.
 I remember you were doing
 one gentleman once and
 you found him very
 interesting, but that's a long time ago.
 He was a drug dealer.
 Oh, I see.
 He had been the
 biggest drug dealer in the country.
 Yeah.
 In Britain.
 And he had been...
 He was in a prison called...
 Oh, it was a terrible prison in Birmingham,
 where they kept the IRA terrorists.
 It was so scary there.
 And he heard Nelson Mandela talking on the radio
 after he came out of prison.
 And he had a kind of conversion.
 And he began...
 In the prison, he began to work with empathy
 and counselling,
 and he was let out early
 because he became such a wonderful person.
 And he ended up being a mentor
 for street gangs.
 So he was a person who had a very...
 His story was very redemptive.
 And he asked...
 He paid me to write his life story.
 And when my father heard
 that I was writing the life story
 of the biggest drug dealer in Britain,
 he was actually quite scared.
 I was a bit scared, actually.
 And after it was written,
 it couldn't be published.
 Because all the other drug dealers
 would have killed us.
 So he's waiting for...
 When we're all...
 And he's still alive.
 Yes.
 He's still alive,
 but it won't be able to be published
 until everybody involved
 who he was a drug dealer with
 is long, long gone.
 But it was such a mixture of worlds,
 because he was black,
 and he was Jamaican,
 and he came from a world, you know,
 where everybody's a criminal.
 They never bought anything.
 They just went into a shop
 and shoplifted.
 They, you know, they used to...
 They didn't regard the world
 as something with rules.
 He and his wife would just turn up
 in a store, steal everything they want,
 and leave.
 And...
 I mean, they were just...
 Um...
 Bandits.
 You imagine coming into my house,
 where I've never even taken a...
 a chocolate or a counter
 in a shop, you know,
 with a little girl or something.
 I mean, we just don't steal anything.
 But we got on very, very well,
 because he had become...
 Normal.
 A very, very great man.
 More than normal.
 He'd become better than us.
 Much, much better.
 So there you are.
 So, Yara, I can't tell you
 to jump up and down
 and waggle your hands.
 Because you have to jump up and down
 and waggle your hands
 if you're tired.
 There's a man I work with
 who makes us all jump up and down
 and waggle our hands
 if we get tired.
 So do you understand
 that I'm not bored?
 I understand.
 Yes.
 It's very, very important
 that you understand that.
 I'm sorry.
 It's very soothing
 and monotonous and...
 No, it's not monotonous.
 It's concentrated.
 The vice, the vice...
 puts you in a...
 I think it's to do with concentrating.
 Concentrating on what you're saying
 and asking the questions.
 What Yara didn't mention
 in the previous chapter
 that when he went through Belgium
 in the car
 there wasn't a single light on
 in the whole country.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 There was no petrol.
 station there was nothing. They were all asleep.
 You were asleep because we were talking about this.
 Yes, but you didn't mention that there was no light. I know that you didn't.
 Can I just ask you, is there something wrong with Belgium? Because when I went to Belgium the last time,
 it had survived for several months without any government.
 And they had, you know, instead of proper loos on the motorway,
 you know, cafes and loos, they were kind of the most terrible portable loos
 that were so dirty and so full and so impossible to use.
 I thought, what is it with this country? It seems to be sort of falling to pieces at the edges.
 And you went through it.
 Yes.
 Imagine there was no light and there was no petrol and there was no petrol.
 Imagine the whole night in absolute darkness.
 Nothing.
 That's true.
 I remember.
 But then again, we went there.
 But there was no stowage.
 The motorway was clear. That was a different case.
 But you could drive through.
 No traffic jams.
 No traffic jams. Not a single car. No nothing.
 And light. What actually amazed me, there were, you know, street lights all the way through the whole of Belgium.
 Well, you know, Tom and I went very often to Germany through Belgium.
 And we stayed always in those beautiful, beautiful little towns like Ghent, you know.
 Yes.
 Oh, yes.
 And they were just utterly perfect. I mean, so beautiful.
 And I remember stopping in a, staying in a little hotel there and coming down in the morning for breakfast.
 And I actually thought they were joking. They gave us so much food.
 I thought, is this insane? I mean, it was just so much food.
 And then my German friend said that the Belgians are famous for giving people too much food.
 That that's their thing, that they feed you too much.
 So they must have been slightly related to Uncle James and Agnes.
 Well, food is love, isn't it? Food is love.
 When I was on a train once going through Spain, the train kept breaking down.
 And we hadn't come with any food because we didn't think the train was going to break down.
 And every time it was a meal, all the Spanish people fed us.
 They didn't leave us.
 They were sorry for you.
 Couldn't speak a word of English and we couldn't speak a word of Spanish, but we were loved and looked after.
 Another town which is beautiful is Bruges.
 Oh, yes. That's the other place we stayed. It's just wonderful.
 And it's on such a nice scale. It's so little, so you can really have a wonderful time.
 The lace makers.
 Yes.
 So I think we're ready to go. It's gone. It's just gone.
 Okay.
 Are you feeling okay?
 Yes, I'm feeling okay.
 What do you need?
 My glasses.
 Glasses. I can get them.
 Where have you put them?
 They're just here.
 Out of my line of vision.
 I still can't remember the name of the...
 Belgium town.
 And it was...
 Near Ostend.
 Near Ostend.
 Near Ostend.
 And it was thank you to a hotel owner who came to sweep up in front of his hotel that Yara was able to ask him about the petrol and he gave him his own petrol out of a...
 A can.
 Can or something.
 Are you going away?
 Antwerp.
 Antwerp.
 I've lived in Antwerp with my daddy.
 Oh, so you do know him?
 That was one of my... one of dad's jobs, that he worked in Antwerp.
 And what art. Oh my God. The art galleries of Belgium actually. Wonderful.
 No, I've never been there.
 You know at the moment in Brussels they've got the whole of the collected works of Chagall.
 Oh, that must be fun. Are you going there?
 We are thinking of it. Just to go on the easy jet for the day and back.
 Yeah.
 Because it costs about 70 quid or something for two. It's incredible. Yara, you have to come a bit nearer.
 You always start reversing for some reason.
 So, where are we going?
 Ready? Ready? So, you and Aunt Robin have just...
 Arrived.
 Got to Antwerp and you were looking for petrol. So you're just driving home and you are running out of petrol.
 Running out of petrol.
 From Antwerp we drove to Ostend, boarded the ferry and the ferry took us to Dover.
 And from Dover we drove to London and we didn't go any further because we were...
 So tired.
 So tired. And so we went to Leicester Square and drank some steak.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 I can't remember what steak it was but she talked about it for a long time.
 It was very good steak.
 It was a very good steak.
 Yes, yes.
 And so we stayed there overnight and the next day we set off and we drove all the way without stopping to Wooler.
 Goodness me.
 And in Wooler, there was... Who was in Wooler? Uncle James and Aunt Edma.
 And when they saw Grandma, our Grandma, so they were sort of...
 Dancing with the night.
 Dancing with joy and kissing each other and then...
 Oh.
 And so...
 And we had a tea and...
 But then it was...
 Soon it was time to go home so we continued and we drove to Edinburgh where we knew it
 very well and we just came here at the corner of the street.
 Where we are now.
 Where we are just now.
 Grandma had a look at it and she said,
 I know this very well.
 I used to stay here with my grandmother.
 You wouldn't believe that of all the streets in Edinburgh, we had to choose just the one she knew.
 And Aunt Margaret hadn't known that when she suggested that flat.
 Because I thought Aunt Margaret found that flat.
 Yes, she did.
 And she read an advertisement and she never mentioned anything.
 Oh.
 Isn't that funny?
 It is.
 Anyway, so we took her home.
 Number 25.
 And took her into the third...
 The flat that I know.
 Yes.
 The flat you know.
 And we took her to the third floor and loaded the car and all children were there of course.
 Jonny boy and Ludie and...
 And did she sleep in the room that I always slept in?
 Yes, and the...
 The big, big, lovely big room.
 Yes.
 Was that like a bedroom and a sitting room?
 Yes.
 She turned it into a bedroom and a sitting room.
 That's right.
 No, it was very nice.
 It's a pity we had to leave it because of...
 Because it was too high up.
 I don't understand how you all fitted in.
 Where did you...
 There was a room for everybody.
 So there was a...
 I don't understand where the other bedroom was.
 There was the bedroom that you and Agnes were in.
 The bedroom...
 The bedroom that I used to stay in.
 Then there's another little bedroom.
 With Jon.
 So where were the girls?
 They were in the front.
 Between the sitting room and the grandma's bedroom there was another room and they had
 a double bed.
 I don't remember that other room.
 So it had four bedrooms that house.
 Yes.
 A room, yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 And a bedroom.
 Yes.
 That house?
 No.
 Other room, yes.
 Oh, right.
 Okay, I didn't remember that other room.
 Anyway, you all fitted in?
 We all fitted in.
 You must have had to have extreme organization around bathrooms.
 Well, that was the problem.
 Yeah.
 Everybody in the morning had to get somewhere in time.
 But we never had any fights or things like that.
 No fist-tick-ups.
 So she arrived and all of the kids were there and you were there and a whole new life began
 with, she was born Roberta, not Robin, but Roberta.
 Roberta Secunda because there was another child called Roberta that died.
 Yes.
 So, okay.
 Yes, she is.
 That's how it was.
 And, no, she spent how many happy years there?
 I think this happened in 72, did it?
 72?
 She came here?
 Yes.
 And she died?
 Ninety?
 Two?
 Ninety-two.
 So she spent 20 years there.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 And she was a very happy person.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And I visited Edinburgh to work and you were by then gone to Constantinople and I spent
 time with her and Aunt Margaret and they were going to the art gallery to study Poussin
 and they took me for lunch in the big store opposite the lovely hotel on Princes Street
 and my friend who was with me, the older lady, she said to me, now I've met your relations,
 now I understand why you are like you are.
 Aren't you caught?
 Because she always couldn't understand, she thought that I was very vivid and then she
 met Aunt Margaret and Aunt Robert and she said, oh I see you.

 The family is vivid.
 And that's nice isn't it?
 I was very pleased about that.
 But Yaro, that was a kind of recap.
 You've actually got back from Abu Dhabi and you've decided to go and work in Dublin and
 the children have all gone into the world and you and Agnes are renting a flat.
 A flat in Dublin.
 Whereabouts in Dublin?
 In Dublin.
 In Dublin.
 In Dublin.

 He was a great sailor. What was your job? What were you doing? Tunnelling. Tunnelling what?
 Tunnelling. There was a tunnel to be built parallel with the Grand Canal. Right.
 And so that was it. But the tunneling was very difficult because it was based between three water waves.
 One was Liffey, the other one was Dodar,
 and the third was Dodar.



















 and sell it to the sea. So between these three we had to build.
 Therefore it was very difficult because it was so much water.
 We just couldn't normally pump it. Or you could use a compressor, that kind of thing, to give water.
 But this was not really possible. So the miners, they were there up to here.
 They ended the whole shift.
 Were they Irish?
 They were Irish. Very nice people.
 And really the Irish, it was the best client I have ever worked for.
 Why is that? What was it about them?
 They were so nice and so understanding.
 And so, yes.
 They were the nicest people I have ever worked for.
 Were they warm-hearted? Was it the sort of warmth of heart?
 Warm-hearted and…
 We still write to the widow of the boss that was supervising the…
 Yes, I have very good memories for Dublin.
 Of course, Dublin itself, it's a very beautiful town.
 And the hills around.
 The hills around.
 So how many years were you there?
 Three years, I think.
 And did you get a kind of extraordinary culture shock? From desert to green?
 Yes, yes, that's right.
 But a sort of lovely culture shock?
 A lovely culture shock.
 A beautiful experience?
 No, it was something entirely different.
 It was really very nice.
 The people were so nice.
 We travelled a lot across here and there on weekends.
 There is so much to see from the culture point of view, from history.
 Prehistory.
 Prehistory. There is so much to see there.
 And lovely gardens and garden estates. Very nice.
 What was going on in Ireland at that time with the IRA?
 It was the IRA and then Bobby Sand.
 So that was all going on, but in the other side?
 Well, Bobby Sand was in Dublin, wasn't he, or something?
 Oh, was he? I don't know.
 He was on the high street.
 In Dublin?
 In Dublin.
 Oh, how frightening.
 And then he died, actually.
 He just refused to eat.
 And that was really very unpleasant.
 But otherwise…
 Otherwise…
 No, no, I would go back any time.
 Right.
 They were trying to…
 They somehow liked me.
 Also, one of the… from the Ministry,
 he was trying to persuade me to stay in Ireland.
 Oh, yes?
 And to live in Kerry.
 Oh, yes?
 And he even started negotiating.
 And there was some place or job for me to do it.
 But at the same time, I got this offer from Istanbul,
 which I couldn't refuse.
 And who made that offer?
 Not John Taylor again?
 John Taylor again.
 Oh, so it was the Irish local authority that tried to get you to stay?
 Yes.
 But John Taylor said,
 we're going to give you an offer you can't refuse.
 Okay, so that was quite hard to leave, was it?
 It was quite hard to leave.
 You didn't say the name of this project at all?
 You didn't mention what it was called?
 Which project?
 The one you were talking about now.
 Where?
 In Ireland.
 In Ireland?
 It had a name which you didn't mention.
 Ring…
 Ring and…
 Ring and…
 Or rings and…
 Oh, yes, but you successfully finished it.
 Oh, yes.
 So, Jero, wherever you go,
 you can find me.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.

 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 I'm Jero.
 this German man. Yes, I know.
 He landed.
 And he went to the Palm Troy.
 He knew where it was because
 he had been there.
 It wasn't the first time. I mean,
 sometimes you get those experiences where you think
 those people have been there.
 There's a writer,
 she's called Mary Reno,
 and when she writes
 about Alexander the Great,
 you absolutely
 know that she knew him.
 She enters
 the world of a
 consciousness as if
 she's been there before. It's kind of amazing.
 So when you, in your next
 life, you will stumble across
 these different things and you'll think,
 this is very familiar.
 I've seen it before. Nice, and you'll be able to do that
 all over the world, Mary.
 Because everything that you've
 built is very solid. It lasts.
 It doesn't ping
 like the bridge.
 That's true.
 I hope.
 But anyway,
 so you finished
 the job.
 I finished the job and so I
 went to Istanbul.
 So tell me why Istanbul
 was something you couldn't refuse.
 Well,
 somehow from history,
 just the name
 and the vision of all
 the
 history.
 Yeah.
 It just was driving
 or pulling me there.
 And quite frankly,
 that was really
 amazing place.
 And it's
 really something which I'm
 grateful for that I finished
 my career in that place.
 Yeah. How many
 years? Fifteen?
 Eleven.
 Eleven.
 Went for two.
 So tell me about
 going,
 Istanbul.
 How, tell me how you felt
 and what you had to organize and.
 Well, it was all very,
 they for some, for example,
 the people in Istanbul,
 they knew all about me.
 So they were expecting me.
 Yeah.
 The Turks.
 Yes.
 And so that, that, that,
 that was helpful.
 They spoke English.
 They spoke English.
 That was, you see the project,
 it was partly financed by the World Bank.
 So this is when the money came.
 And this is why the Turks are able to,
 to afford it.
 Yeah.
 Because, and, but the part I went to,
 and it was the only one we actually got the commission for,
 was it, it included the very, very old Constantinople.
 When you look at the,
 You see, you can see it on the left hand side.
 Yeah.
 There is this peninsula.
 It looks very small, but it counted for 2 million people.
 Right, right.
 So this is where I started,
 and it involved quite a lot of design work,
 which I did on the spot there.
 And was this once again a plant for processing wastewater?
 Yes.
 For the whole of Constantinople?
 First of all, collecting it, you know,
 so you need collectors,
 because before we start, just like in Edinburgh,
 if somebody pulls a chain,
 it's going to go straight into the sea without any treatment,
 and the same goes here, even worse.
 And so, for example,
 when I knew about this place from my studies in the ...
 In what?
 No.
 You know, I'm getting so stupid.
 In London? No.
 No, in Prague.
 No, it was in Prague.
 When I went to gymnasium in Prague, there,
 we had a professor of geography.
 Yes.
 And he was very keen on Istanbul.
 I never knew that.
 How funny. It's a coincidence.
 He was very keen on Istanbul, and he was, I remember to this day,
 I was saying, gentlemen, the Golden Horn,
 it's the most beautiful place in the Earth.
 On the Earth.
 You see there, it's the water and beautiful boats
 with beautiful ladies on with parasols
 and surrounded by palm trees and things like that.
 It's really the most beautiful spot on Earth.
 When I go there, when I saw it, it was just an open sewer,
 most dreadful place.
 The water had become so ...
 It was so polluted.
 Yes.
 The sea of the Golden Horn.
 The sea of the Golden Horn.
 Was sewage.
 Was sewage, yes.
 And that had been going on for how many hundreds of years,
 just pouring sewage into the water?
 Yes.
 Since the beginning of Constantinople?
 That's right.
 And that's why they called you?
 Because, I mean, was it making people ill?
 Typhoid and things like this?
 Yes.
 All this was there.
 And so,
 our task was really to prevent this,
 so we built a system of tunnels on the coast
 parallel with the sea and parallel with the Golden Horn.
 Yeah.
 And so all the wastewater from the town,
 when I say system, I mean tunnels,
 tunnels on the coast, and so ...
 All the water just goes into the tunnels.
 Mm-hmm.
 And then it follows the tunnels are built on a slope.
 Yes.
 And eventually, it goes near the Bosphorus.
 Right.
 And at that point, we built a long sea outfall.
 A low sea ...
 Outfall. Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.
 And the outfall consisted of twin pipes,
 over 2 meters in diameter.
 So it has enormous capacity.
 And so this is how we designed it.
 So where did the waste go in the end?
 Into the sea after it was treated?
 After it's been treated.
 Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
 Before it's discharged with this pipe
 that we are talking about, there is a treatment plant.
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
 So it's treated.
 Cleaned, yeah.
 Cleaned. Mm-hmm.
 And so ... But this was actually ...
 It was the first commission we got,
 and it was meant for 2 years. Mm-hmm.
 And when we designed it and when we saw
 that they were somehow pleased with us, the Turks,
 so they said, Why don't you stay here a bit longer?
 And eventually, from 2 years, they became 11.
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
 And which pleased me nowhere because ...
 Yeah.
 You know, that's ...
 And some of the pipes are really very, very, very long.
 Mm-hmm.
 And what happened about the sea?
 How did the sea get cleaned up?
 Was it just cleaning itself
 because stuff wasn't going into it anymore?
 That's one thing, and the other thing is,
 the sea contains a lot of oxygen,
 breaks up the dirty water.
 Yes.
 And this is how it cleans it.
 Cleans it. Mm-hmm.
 So is that sea now clean?
 The sea is clean.
 I saw some pictures from Istanbul just the other day,
 and there are fishermen whipping the water and catching fish.
 So, yeah, you've done amazing things in your life, haven't you?
 I mean, you've made such a difference to something.
 I feel so proud of you that you did that.
 I will have to go and look at that sea
 and think how you cleaned it.
 It's just amazing.
 The next time I go to Turkey, I will go there.
 Go there? Turkey, ignoring what I said,
 but Turkey is really a wonderful place.
 Yes.
 And there is so much to see there.
 Mm-hmm.
 Most of it, it's not really Turkish.
 Mm-hmm.
 It's either Roman or Greek.
 Yes.
 Or Armenian or whatever, but even the Turkish part,
 it's really wonderful place to be in,
 and we were so lucky, although we spent 11 years,
 but we rented a house,
 flat in the house, overlooking the Bosphorus,
 so you could just woke up in the morning,
 and see where it was.
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
 And the Bosphorus is a river or a sea?
 It's a connection between two seas.
 Oh, yes.
 It's the North Sea, and down below,
 you get the Sea of Marmara.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 I see, okay.
 And from the Sea of Marmara,
 it all goes down to Adrian Sea.
 Right. Adrian Sea.
 So let me just...
 I'm going to start again here,
 so that we don't get too much on one section.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 in Turkey and you worked there for 11 years and you've described the work you did. What
 is really important for you now to tell us about Turkey?
 It was in the end, it was an enormous project. Enormous project, value of about one billion
 dollars. So it was really a big job. And it's, I wasn't the only one, the only person actually
 involved in this. There were other persons even before me.
 Working with John Taylor?
 No, it was some Dutch firm.

 Working and, but we, we, John Taylor took it. It was actually, it was not only John
 Taylor, but it was a joint venture with Binnie's, Binnie and Partners.
 Oh yes.
 So, but neither firm no longer exists.
 Oh right.
 Because of various...
 Well they've taken over by bigger things.
 Yes.
 Oh right, so they've been...

 They're there, but they're incorporated now.
 Incorporated in this. But it's, you know, the distances there and the town itself, it's
 so, so enormous. If I say that from one end of Istanbul to this Sea of Marmara.
 Yes.
 It's about 80 kilometers.
 Yes.
 So it gives you some idea about the scale of, you know, of the undertaking. But, as I
 said, it's so, so, so lively and there's so much to see there. And for eating, again,
 every evening you can go and the Turks are far more entertaining, entertaining with food.
 Mm-hmm.
 And the food is really most delicious.
 Mm-hmm.
 Which, I mean, the Turkish, they can't be really compared with this.
 Mm-hmm.
 You don't know where the Turks came from, but came such a variety of food.
 Mm-hmm.
 But it's really...
 Is it a...
 Um...
 It's not a Muslim country, is it?
 Oh, it is.
 It hasn't...
 Hasn't it...
 Did Ataturk get rid of the Muslim religion?
 Well, he tried, but he didn't succeed.
 Oh, right.
 And now the Muslim, it's sort of filtering back.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 Mm-hmm.
 He...
 It's...
 Yeah, this...
 A place like the Istanbul, it's very cosmopolitan.
 You get the Roman Catholics are there, there are churches and so on.
 Yes.
 The Orthodox Greeks...
 Yes.
 It's...
 If I say that, you know, there is one church on the coast of the Bosphorus, and so on, where
 the patriarchs...
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.

 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 The patriarchs.
 Then you have the Armenians, as I mentioned this, and then you've got, of course, the Muslims.
 And they are the strongest. And there are so many mosques everywhere you go.
 And every morning they all start singing, you see, at about four o'clock in the morning.
 Is it quite tolerant there? Oh yes. It's a gentle kind of...
 It is tolerant. It's... I certainly got on with them very well.
 And some people, when I went there, they said, you know, impossible to work with.
 That was not my impression. What did they mean?
 Well, there was one man who said he was being observed when he was going to work.
 And how long he was at work. And that kind of thing.
 I never had this kind of impression.
 But at the same time, I...
 Oh, I see.
 Well, the job was so enormous and so important, it might be, that it was well worth doing.
 And the job that you went on to do for the next years, was it the same job just over a larger area?
 Yes. Yes.
 Because initially it just covered the little peninsula you can see on the left-hand side at the bottom.
 But now it's spread all over.
 Oh, yeah.
 So you did that. You did all that.
 Golly, yeah.
 Well, it was well worth doing.
 You know, I don't think that people like you should retire.
 It's a waste, really.
 You are quite right.
 I think it's ridiculous.
 I wish that you didn't have to retire. You could have carried on doing really interesting things.
 Did you retire because you wanted to, or...?
 Or is it you have to legally, or...?
 I'll tell you why I retired.
 Because just before I sort of decided on the retirement, the Turks somehow ran out of money.
 Oh, I see.
 And so I was sitting there doing nothing.
 And so I said, well, to hell with this.
 If I come to you, it had nothing to do with engineering.
 It was just...
 And the World Bank, unfortunately, didn't sort of help me from this point of view.
 So that was a great pity.
 So how old were you when you retired?
 I was 60.
 65.
 Right.
 And you came here and lived in the flat.
 I lived in that flat.
 But I mean, for a person like you to not have something valuable to do after a life like that,
 I mean, hasn't it been difficult?
 Well, it has, but I always found something to do.
 One was for instance, I joined this choir, which was a wonderful choir, singing music which one doesn't sort of sing very often.
 And then they, because everything has to be paid these days, you need money for this, so they made me the treasurer.
 And so I was really busy doing this treasurer's job.
 And...
 So...
 That's all I can say.
 And they themselves, you know, when they were out of money and they knew I was going, they even made a huge farewell party.
 But they never said, why don't you save it?
 And we'll find the money.
 We might find the money because...
 Was that in Istanbul?
 Yes.
 It was a great pity.
 But they would have wanted you to stay even longer, if you had wanted to stay.
 If they had the money, I would have probably stayed.
 You would be there now.
 I would be there now.
 And we would come and visit you.
 We would be loving.
 That was a wonderful place, even for visits.
 And the flag was there.
 The flag we had was not very big.
 But the views.
 You see, looking down, you see the new bridge there and you can see the whole Bosphorus,
 up and down.
 And when you...
 Did you tell me once that you used to have to fill the bath with water in the morning?
 Oh yes.
 Well, that was...
 There was a lack of water.
 Was that every single day?
 Well, when...
 Just when we retired.
 Well, that was...
 That was...
 That was very hard.
 But that was another thing which sort of contributed to my decision.
 Because there was no...
 There was no water.
 They didn't...
 They just ran out of town, just ran out of water.
 So how on earth did people survive?
 Well...
 I mean, did that go on for years, that there was no water?
 That was going on for...
 Maybe it's going even today.
 So you needed...
 They needed you to stay to sort that out as well.
 Well, I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 I think that's...
 Turkish bath? Well, you could do, but even the Turkish baths didn't... They ran out of water too.
 They ran out of water too. But did you live without water only at the end? Only in the end. The last year or something?
 They imported water from the other side of the Bosphorus for a period. For instance, hotels
 couldn't afford to be without water, so under a hotel there were two lorries every evening
 pumping water so that the visitors could wash their hands. And hospitals as well.
 So they... but it was really very, very difficult. But this was nothing new because
 there is a system
 of dams on the left-hand side which was built by the Ottomans.
 And it's up... even in those days, it's comparatively smaller when you look at it now,
 but even that, they were short of water. Yes, yes. And so when you left 11 years later,
 you were 65, you came to Edinburgh, and Aunt Margaret
 died. Yes. And that's how I got to know you again. Because Agnes knew that I was living in Aberdeen.
 Yes. And she rang my father. We visited you in Aberdeen. No, but first you rang my father.
 Yeah. And he said to me, you have to ring Agnes. She wants to tell you when Aunt Margaret's funeral
 is. Yeah. And so I came down and went to Aunt Margaret's funeral, and then we started to...
 Yeah.
 ...to visit you. Yeah.
 And then we started to... Yeah.





 we started to meet regularly actually we've been meeting regularly ever since then yeah and that
 was a year apart i don't know what yarrow was 65. when you were 65 it doesn't matter
 we can write it down he's still but i i just missed you living in constantinople i i just
 missed going to visit you yeah i know you then even my husband came and
 it became very popular the place we had so many visitors robin rob robin came to me yes
 and uncle james he was already good yes yes the regular and the children came the children came
 did aunt barbara come no no she said she had
 not traveled she didn't want to go anywhere well we with uncle james we made so many trips
 of gallipoli for instance so we took him there yeah and he he really enjoyed this and
 had he been in the war uncle james had he been a soldier in the war i don't think so because he
 was a doctor or he was too young or i think he was a doctor
 yeah we never asked him why not his granddad my granddad his brother was captured at arnhem
 which one was he in the family how hector douglas hector was first hector was the first
 and then
 admir
 was it i can't do it off my head um but if hector was the
 oldest. Do you happen to know whether there was a lost child at the beginning?
 Well I told you that there was a Roberta missing. But was she right at the
 beginning? Do you know? Because Hector was not a first child in the way he behaved.
 He behaved like a second child running off and going to be a car mechanic in
 Australia and marrying a girl from the outback. I mean he did not behave like a...
 a first child is normally responsible and tradition and he was the exact
 opposite. I wonder if there was a child lost before him and he was actually a
 second child. Well there was also something with the Second World War
 and the father. He was sent to Isle of Man. Oh was he? He was in turn
 Yeah. And all the people who started Camp Hill, where I worked, they were all on the Isle of Man.
 Really?
 So they would have all been on the Isle of Man at the same time.
 And why were they there?
 Because they were Jewish-German, they were Viennese, but they were not considered, they were enemy aliens.
 Oh, yes, yes.
 Even though they had fled for their lives.
 Yeah.
 So it was my great-grandfather on the Isle of Man for a long, long time, for the whole war.
 For the whole war?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well, did he ever talk about it?
 Do you know?
 No, he didn't talk about anything.
 Because my people who I knew, they turned it into a university.
 They didn't just suffer.
 They turned it into a sort of cultural opportunity.
 But when you look at the children, how they were born one after the other, most of them
 were born before the war.
 Yeah.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 Yes.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 And then they were born in the same year.
 very as I would say vivacious maybe she married a Pilkington right so we're not
 talking about your life now we have to be careful so I just want to make a gap
 because I want to ask you something
 yeah we can easily but we will do that when we edit
 yeah but we can easily

 so before we do the next one
 I wanted to ask you something
 so Yarrow
 it's not recording
 you
 wanted to write your story
 because you wanted to give it to your children
 so now you've reached 65
 and you are already 80
 how old are you now?
 83
 83
 so my daddy's older than you
 he's going to be 85
 and Tom's daddy's 85 as well
 so

 Now the next part of your life is your retirement.
 Would you like to talk about that now?
 Or would you like to...
 Well, it's still continuous, isn't it?
 Couldn't we just stop this and leave that until somehow next time?
 Or...
 It's half past five.
 Yes, you must do what you would like.
 We have to do what you feel comfortable with.
 So you would prefer to wait for the next bit.
 Because what I'd like to...
 I'd love a little session about what I'd love to ask you is that question about Thomas
 Martin, what do you live for?
 What do you feel is important that you've learned from your life?
 Before we go on to the next part.
 I think it would be nice to...
 Because you sort of told this incredible story.
 And basically you must have built up a whole life philosophy about what you believe is
 important and...
 Is that okay if I ask you about that?
 Yes.
 Could I turn it on again then?
 Yes.
 So I'll just ask the question into the tape so they get it.
 So Jero, you had a very, very long and meaningful life.
 And out of all of this long life, where everywhere you've been you've left something changed
 and transformed in some way.
 You've also had lots of relationships and lots of family.
 What do you feel is important that you would like to tell your children for the future?
 From my point of view, the most important thing is to see what one left behind.
 And that's what I think is important.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 I think that's the most important thing.
 including our children and so on.
 I'm thinking that perhaps I could have spent more time
 with John Ludin and Ines, her and Peggy, pardon me.
 And that I could have spent more time with them,
 leading them to something,
 but I'm not quite sure whether this is really ...
 required.
 What makes you think that?
 Do you feel that you didn't spend enough time with them?
 Well, what is enough?
 I'm just thinking that sometimes
 I could have spent more time with them,
 and for instance, even now, we have ...
 suddenly we don't see our John at all.
 Does he not come in the summer?
 Well, he comes for ...
 he's so irregular, and it really bothers me,
 and so I'm just wondering whether I've done something wrong,
 so which sort of guides him away from me.
 I don't think so.
 So, Jaro, could I just ask you,
 have you ever considered writing and asking him that?
 No, I don't think that that would be really helpful.
 Why not?
 Well, I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Because I've got an amazing life philosophy.
 Shall I just turn this off?
 Yes.
 Or can I talk into the tape?
 Because I think it's a conversation about your life.
 Can I carry on with the tape on?
 Yes, you can carry on.
 Okay, because I've discovered that
 one of many things that I've learned,
 one of many things that I've learned, is that,
 one of my greatest new steps in my life
 is that if I'm worried about something,
 I actually go and ask the person.
 And I always discover that it's completely different
 from what I'm worrying about.
 And I'm always so glad that I've asked.
 But I think ...
 I can't give you advice, because you are your own person,
 but I think you might discover that it had absolutely ...
 nothing to do with anything that you have done.
 No.
 It could be to do with the pressure of life.
 Could be.
 Because John is very successful in his career, isn't he?
 Yes, he is.
 And so they just ...
 I mean, Tom doesn't have one single second of his life.
 I mean, it's just ridiculous.
 And when men are in the middle of their work,
 and John isn't married, he doesn't have children,
 and so he gives all his life to his work, so ...
 I think it would be ...
 You know, it's really important to ask things.
 I wanted to make sure that there was nothing
 that I had left unasked before I lost people who I loved, or ...
 You know, I wanted to make sure that we had talked about everything
 we needed to talk about.
 And it has always worked for the good if I've done that.
 And how beautiful for John if you just wrote him a letter and asked.
 What makes you think it wouldn't be helpful, if I may ask?
 I think it may put him off.
 Oh, no, he would be touched.
 I bet you ...
 I bet you 50 quid.
 She's putting her hand where ...
 I bet you 50 quid, if you please, would be right back.
 Or phone immediately, or ...
 I mean, you can't lose, can you, if he's out of touch.
 He's always okay when he speaks to Yara,
 or when Yara rings up, or when I ring up, and so on.
 He's always as if he just stopped talking a minute ago.
 There's no gap in there.
 It's work.
 It's really ...
 He always says that he has to prepare for the ...
 Prepare for the budget and all these things.
 It's all work, Yara. It's all work.
 You know, I've got a piece of paper on my wall.
 I've turned it off, by the way.
 Who ...
 Because I do this thing called vocational training,
 where I help people find their vocation,
 so that they love their work.
 And there is a thing there which is five things that people regret when they're dying.
 Oh!
 So ...
 One of the things that is top of the list is,
 I did not spend enough time with the people I loved because I was working.
 That's John.
 He's working.
 He's completely overwhelmed with his work,
 because he's got such a high-powered job, hasn't he?
 And the other thing is ...
 I'm trying to think what they are ...
 I'm trying to think what they are ...
 Realizing that ...
 Not realizing that happiness is a choice,
 is one of them.
 Doing what other people wanted instead of what I really wanted,
 is the third.
 I can't remember them all.
 You didn't tell them ...
 Being authentic,
 speaking out of your real ...
 voice,
 saying what you really think and feel.
 And tell them that you love them ...
 without having to be prompted.
 Telling people you love them is good.
 I have a ...
 There's a writer who I love very much.
 She's called Ann Michaels.
 I just love her books.
 And just when I was in America recently,
 I was in the same town as her,
 working in the same town,
 and I wrote and said,
 could I invite her to my work,
 because she's in my work.
 And she said she couldn't come,
 because actually she was just about to go to England ...
 to launch her new book.
 And I read her new book,
 and I wrote and said to her ...
 What is it called?
 What is it called?
 Oh Lord, I've forgotten.
 I'll look it up on the internet.
 Okay.
 It's a book of paintings.
 And then ...
 A friend of hers has done paintings of people like Paul Celan,
 and very, very beautiful, brave people,
 who did amazing things in the war.
 And then she's written wonderful things about them.
 It's absolutely beautiful,
 and it unfolds like an accordion.
 It's a lovely, lovely book.
 Anyway, I wrote to her.
 I wrote and said,
 Ann,
 I read this book,
 and I just ...
 I don't understand how somebody ...
 You probably feel like that about music.
 You hear certain music,
 you think,
 how ...
 How did you put into sound this reality
 that is beyond everything?
 And I wrote and said that about her book.
 And she said,
 I feel so, so worried about my creativity,
 and I was feeling so down about myself,
 and my work, and my life,
 and I just thank you so much for ...
 Thank you.
 Thank you.

 so that you can go into hospital actually feeling that you've told him what you feel.
 It will make you feel all relaxed and loved when you go into hospital.
 Because I tell you, those hardworking men with no woman to help them.
 I mean, if Tom didn't have me, he would get up in the morning,
 he would turn his house into a rat run.
 He'd get up in the morning and he'd have a tunnel to the kitchen
 and a tunnel to the bathroom,
 and the whole house would slowly get covered in dust.
 And all he would do is work.
 And it's women who stop men doing that.
 And John isn't married, and he's got that big high-powered job,
 so he's completely uncivilized in one way.
 You know that it says that,
 when God made man and woman,
 he took out the middle, he took out the rib to make the woman.
 And Tom says that marriage is the putting back of the middle into the man,
 and the giving to the woman, the head and the limbs.
 So you compliment each other when you marry.
 And when a man doesn't have that,
 he just becomes very wonderful.
 And I think that's the one side of it.
 That's a good one.
 But if I am allowed to give you any heartfelt advice,
 I would write to him.
 Okay.
 I mean, and the thing is to be completely simple.
 I mean, it's very simple.
 You just say,
 Dearest John,
 I see so little of you,
 I wonder if I have in some way
 made you feel unwelcome.
 And I would love to know how you are,
 and I love you.
 That's it.
 That's all you have to do.
 And I bet you 50 quid would take money on it.
 You will ring me up two days later and say,
 Oh my God,
 I've had the most amazing conversation with John.
 And it would be so important to do that.
 Because you know, your heart must be really heavy about this.
 It's horrible thinking that about somebody,
 especially when you're a woman.
 Especially your first beloved child.
 But I think it's total invention that he would have done something to John.
 Of course you haven't.
 But Yarrow has to find that out.
 It doesn't...

 let me just write this in. Session 11. 11 you've done, goodness. Okay, so I'm getting the feeling
 that you'd actually like to stop now. Would you like to try a little bit after supper?
 Maybe, yes. And also we could, there's also a little bit of time in the morning before
 I go, but you just feel... You should have a free time in the morning, it's too much
 for you. What I'm saying is that you should, you are, I'm doing this under your command,
 so you tell me what you want and I'll do it. Okay. You don't have to worry about...
 me. I will fit in if you...
